# Qiskit Code Assistant

The Qiskit Code Assistant aims to make quantum computing more accessible to new Qiskit adopters, and improve the coding experience for current users

The Qiskit Code Assistant is a generative AI code assistant powered by [watsonx](watsonx.ai). It is trained using millions of text tokens from Qiskit SDK v1.x, years of Qiskit code examples and IBM Quantum features. The Qiskit Code Assistant can help your quantum development workflow by offering LLM-generated suggestions based on [IBM Granite 8B Code](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) that incorporate the latest features and functionalities from IBM.

The user has a comment in the code to get the available backends for their account in IBM Quantum, the Qiskit Code Assistant gives a code suggestion to get the available backends. The user executes the code, gets the available backends in IBM Quantum Platform for the current account.

## Features

* Accelerate Qiskit code generation by leveraging generative AI based on the `granite-8b-qiskit` model.
* Use abstract and specific prompts to generate recommendations.
* Manage code changes by reviewing, accepting, and rejecting suggestions.
* Supports Python code and Jupyter notebook files.
* Extensions available for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) and [JupyterLab.](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Includes guardrails to avoid answering questions that represent a potential risk for users, such as hateful speech.

To use the Qiskit Code Assistant, check out how to use the official extensions for [JupyterLab](/guides/qiskit-code-assistant-jupyterlab) and [VSCode](/guides/qiskit-code-assistant-vscode) to integrate Qiskit Code Assistant directly into your development environment.

## The Large Language Model (LLM) behind the Qiskit Code Assistant

To provide code suggestions in the context of the Qiskit Code Assistant we use a Large Language Model (LLM). In this case, the Qiskit Code Assistant relies on the model `granite-8b-qiskit`, built on top of the IBM's [granite-8b-code model](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-code-models). The `granite-8b-qiskit` model improves the `granite-8b-code` model's code generation capabilities for Qiskit through extended pretraining and fine-tuning it on high-quality Qiskit data plus python commits and chat. Know more about IBM's Granite models family in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04324). Check out more details about our `granite-.*-qiskit` models in [the related paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19495)

The model `granite-8b-qiskit` model is expected to be open source soon.

## The Qiskit HumanEval benchmark

To test the `granite-8b-qiskit` model, we are creating, in collaboration with Qiskit Advocates and experts, a new execution-based benchmark called Qiskit HumanEval (QHE). This benchmark is similar to [HumanEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), including multiple challenging code problems to solve, all based on the official Qiskit libraries.

The benchmark is composed by ~150 tests, each one composed by a function definition, followed by a docstring which details the task the model is required to solve. Each example also includes a reference canonical solution, as well as unittests in order to evaluate the correctness of the generated solutions. There are three levels of difficulty for tests: Basic, Intermediate and Difficult.


The dataset for the Qiskit HumanEval is expected to be open source soon.
