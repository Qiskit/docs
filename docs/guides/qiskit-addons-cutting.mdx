# Circuit cutting

Circuit cutting is a technique to increase the size of circuits we can run on quantum hardware at the cost of an additional sampling overhead This package implements this technique; where a handful of gates and/or wires are cut, resulting in smaller circuits that are better suited for execution on hardware. These smaller circuits are then executed and the results of the original circuit are reconstructed through using classical post-processing. However, the trade-off is that the overall number of shots must increase by a factor exponential in the number of cuts made. Circuit cutting can also be used to engineer gates between distant qubits which would otherwise require a large swap overhead.

### Key terms

- **subcircuits**: The set of circuits resulting from cutting gates in a `QuantumCircuit` and then separating the disconnected qubit subsets into smaller circuits. These circuits contain [`SingleQubitQPDGate`s](../api/qiskit-addon-cutting/qpd-single-qubit-qpd-gate) and are used to instantiate each subexperiment.

- **subexperiment**: A term used to describe the unique circuit samples associated with a subcircuit which are sent to a QPU for execution.

## Install the circuit cutting package

There are three ways to install the circuit cutting package: PyPI, building from source, and running within a containerized environment. It is recommended to install these packages in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to ensure separation between package dependencies.

### Install from PyPI

The most straightforward way to install the `qiskit-addon-cutting` package is via PyPI
```bash
pip install qiskit-addon-cutting
```

### Install from source

If you wish to contribute to this package or want to install it manually, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting.git
```
and install the package via `pip`. If you plan on running the tutorials found in the package repository, install the notebook dependencies as well. If you plan on developing in the repository, you may also want to install the `dev` dependencies.
```bash
pip install tox notebook -e '.[notebook-dependencies,dev]'
```

### Use within Docker

A dockerfile is included in the addon repository which can be used to build a docker image. There is also a `compose.yaml` file which allows you to use the Docker image with the following commands

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting.git
cd qiskit-addon-cutting
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
    If you are using `podman` and `podman-compose` instead of `docker`, the commands are:
    ```bash
    podman machine start
    podman-compose --podman-pull-args short-name-mode="permissive" build
    podman-compose up
    ```

Once the container is running, you should see a message similar to:
```
notebook_1  |     To access the server, open this file in a browser:
notebook_1  |         file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-7-open.html
notebook_1  |     Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
notebook_1  |         http://e4a04564eb39:8888/lab?token=00ed70b5342f79f0a970ee9821c271eeffaf760a7dcd36ec
notebook_1  |      or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=00ed70b5342f79f0a970ee9821c271eeffaf760a7dcd36ec
```

The *last* URL in this message will give you access to the Jupyter notebook interface. 

Additionally, the home directory includes a subdirectory named persistent-volume. All work you would like to save should be placed in this directory, as it is the only one that will be saved across different container runs.
