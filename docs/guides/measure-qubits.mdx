# Measure qubits

To get information about a qubit's state, you can _measure_ it onto a [classical bit](/api/qiskit/circuit#qiskit.circuit.Clbit). In Qiskit, measurements are performed in the computational basis, i.e., the single-qubit Pauli-$Z$ basis. A measurement will thus yield 0 or 1 depending on the overlap with the Pauli-$Z$ eigenstates $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.

## Apply a measurement to a circuit

There are several ways to apply measurement to a circuit:

### `Measure` class

The Qiskit [Measure](/api/qiskit/circuit#qiskit.circuit.Measure) class measures the specified qubits.

Examples:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

qc = QuantumCircuit(5, 5)
qc.x(0)
qc.x(1)
qc.x(4)
qc.measure(range(5), range(5)) #  Measures all qubits into the corresponding clbit.
```

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 1)
qc.x([0, 2])
qc.measure(1, 0)    # Measure qubit 1 into the classical bit 0.
```

### `measure_all` method

To measure all qubits into the corresponding classical bits, use the [`measure_all`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#measure_all) method. By default, this method adds new classical bits in a `ClassicalRegister` to store these measurements.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 1)
qc.x([0, 2])
qc.measure_all() # Measure all qubits.
```

******************************************************
QUESTION:
**WHEN I RUN THE ABOVE CODE AND ADD qc.draw("mpl"), IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANY MEASUREMENTS ARE ACTUALLY ADDED, BUT IF I USE qc.measure(1, 0) INSTEAD, I SEE A MEASUREMENT. WHAT IS HAPPENING?**
*******************************************************

### `measure_active` method

To measure all qubits that are not idle, use the [`measure_active`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#measure_active) method. This method creates a new `ClassicalRegister` with a size equal to the number of non-idle qubits being measured.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 1)
qc.x([0, 2])
qc.measure_active() # Measure qubits that are not idle.
```


<Admonition type="attention" title="Important notes">

* Circuits that contain operations _after_ a measurement are called dynamic circuits. Note, that not all backends or simulators might support these.
* Each qubit can be measured only once.
* There must be at least one classical register in order to use measurements.
* The Sampler primitive requires circuit measurements. You can add circuit measurements with the Estimator primitive, but they are ignored.
