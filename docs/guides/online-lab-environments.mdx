# Online lab environments

In addition to downloading and installing Qiskit to work on your local machine, there are several options available for those who prefer to work in an online development environment.

Several providers offer online Jupyter environments with Qiskit pre-installed for fast and convenient onboarding. These recommended providers include the cloud service provider OVHcloud and the quantum software development cloud platform qBraid.

Additional online Jupyter notebook environments like IBM Watson&reg; Studio, Google Colab, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio can be used to work with Qiskit by following the instructions below.

## Recommended notebook environments with Qiskit pre-installed

### OVH Cloud AI Notebooks

Users of OVHcloud Public Cloud and OVHcloud Startup can now leverage their OVHcloud quantum notebooks to access Qiskit and submit jobs to IBM Quantum hardware with their IBM Quantum or IBM Cloud&reg; account.

### Getting started with qBraid Lab

Qiskit users can leverage qBraid’s pre-configured Python environments by following the instructions below. For more information, see the [qBraid Docs.](https://docs.qbraid.com/home/introduction)

## Additional notebook environments for Qiskit users

For platforms without Qiskit pre-configured, the setup instructions are largely the same. Users will need to create an account, start a new project (or “notebook” or “workspace,” depending on the platform), and pip install Qiskit.
