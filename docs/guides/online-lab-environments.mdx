# Online lab environments

In addition to downloading and installing Qiskit to work on your local machine, there are several options available for those who prefer to work in an online development environment.

Several providers offer online Jupyter environments with Qiskit pre-installed for fast and convenient onboarding. These recommended providers include the cloud service provider OVHcloud and the quantum software development cloud platform qBraid.

Additional online Jupyter notebook environments like IBM Watson&reg; Studio, Google Colab, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio can be used to work with Qiskit by following the instructions below.

## Recommended notebook environments with Qiskit pre-installed

### OVH Cloud AI Notebooks

Users of OVHcloud Public Cloud and OVHcloud Startup can now leverage their OVHcloud quantum notebooks to access Qiskit and submit jobs to IBM Quantum hardware with their IBM Quantum or IBM Cloud&reg; account. To learn more, visit the [OVHcloud Documentation and tutorials](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/world-documentation?id=kb_home) page.

<Admonition type="note">
OVHcloud AI notebooks are not available in some regions, such as the United States. Additionally, user interfaces might look different in different regions.

Follow these steps to get started:

1. [Set up an OVHcloud account.](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-account-create-ovhcloud-account?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0043022)
2. [Create an OVH Public Cloud project.](https://support.us.ovhcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002245784-Creating-Your-First-Public-Cloud-Project)
6. Follow the steps in [Launch your first AI Notebook,](https://help.ovhcloud.com/csm/en-public-cloud-ai-notebooks-definition?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0048270) selecting **Qiskit** for the framework.

### Getting started with qBraid Lab

Qiskit users can leverage qBraid’s pre-configured Python environments by following the instructions below. For more information, see the [qBraid Docs.](https://docs.qbraid.com/home/introduction)

1. [Set up an qBraid free account.](https://docs.qbraid.com/home/account)
3. [Create a Jupyter Lab Environment.](https://docs.qbraid.com/lab/user-guide/getting-started)
3. After launching qBraid Lab, create a Jupyter notebook by clicking **Python 3** in the Notebook section.
4. Install necessary [Qiskit packages](./install-qiskit) by using the information in the [Pip (magic) commands](https://docs.qbraid.com/lab/user-guide/notebooks#pip-magic-commands) topic.

## Additional notebook environments for Qiskit users

For platforms without Qiskit pre-configured, the setup instructions are largely the same. Users will need to create an account, start a new project (or “notebook” or “workspace,” depending on the platform), and pip install Qiskit.

### Getting started with IBM Watson Studio

(1) Set Up Watson Studio Free Trial

Visit the Watson Studio landing page.
Create an IBM Cloud account and start a free trial.
(2) Create a Watson Studio Project

Click on "New Project" and follow the prompts.
(3) Install Qiskit Packages and dependencies needed
Open a new notebook and run:
!pip install qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime pylatexenc !yes | pip uninstall simplejson

### Getting Started with Google Colab

(1) Set Up Google Account

Visit the Google Colab landing page.
Sign in with your Google account or create a new one.
(2) Create a Notebook and Install Qiskit
Click on "+ New Notebook" and run:
%pip install qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime

### Getting Started with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio

(1) Set Up Azure Account

Visit the Azure landing page.
Create a free trial account.
(2) Create Azure ML Studio Workspace and Install Qiskit
Create a new workspace and a compute resource.
Open a new notebook and run:
%pip install qiskit qiskit-ibm-runtime

And that is it! If you need help getting started with any of these online notebook environments, be sure to check the corresponding platform documentation, or consider dropping a question in the Qiskit Slack channel.
