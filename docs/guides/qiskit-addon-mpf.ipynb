    "# Multi-product formula (MPF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-product formulas (MPF) can be used to more accurately simulate the dynamics of a quantum system at the cost of increased runtime. This is a post-processing technique which mitigates the error of expectation values for time evolved states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical computing is used to solve a system of linear equations which provide coefficients to a weighted combination of several circuit executions. Using this weighted combination can reduce the error associated with simulating time evolution, given a good selection of Trotter steps. The MPF tool will ingest a selection of data --- including the number of Trotter steps and the order of the Trotter approximation --- to prepare and solve (or approximate the solution of) the associated system of linear equations which you can then use to post-process expectation value measurements of a time evolved state."

    "\n",
    "There are two ways of installing the MPF package. Via PyPI and building from source. We also recommend installing these in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to ensure separation between package dependencies.\n",
