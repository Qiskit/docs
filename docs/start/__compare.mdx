# backend.run compared to Qiskit Runtime

There are two methods for accessing IBM Quantum systems. First, the `qiskit-ibm-provider` package provides the `backend.run()` interface, allowing direct access to IBM Quantum systems with no pre- or post-processing involved. This level of access is suitable for those users who want **precise control** over circuit execution and result processing. This level of access is needed for those at the level of kernel developer who are looking to develop, for example, circuit optimization routines or error mitigation techniques, or who want to characterize quantum systems.

In contrast, Qiskit Runtime is designed to **streamline algorithm and application construction** by removing the need for users to understand technical hardware and low-level software details. Advanced processing techniques for error suppression and mitigation are automatically applied, giving users high-fidelity results without the burden of having to code these routines themselves. Sessions within Qiskit Runtime allow users to run iterative algorithm circuits back to back, or batch collections of circuits without having to re-queue each job. This results in more efficient quantum processor use and reduces the time users spend running complex computations.
