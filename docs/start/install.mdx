# Install and set up Qiskit

Whether you will work locally or in a cloud environment, the first step for all users is to install Qiskit. For those wanting to run on a real backend, your next step is to choose one of two channels in order to access IBM Quantum systems: IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Cloud.

## Install and set up Qiskit with the Qiskit Runtime Client

1. Install Python. Check the requirements in the [setup.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/setup.py) file to determine which Python versions are supported.  For download instructions, see the [Python Beginners Guide.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

    We recommend that you use [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to separate Qiskit from other applications.  We also recommend that you use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) development environment to interact with Qiskit.

    1. Create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it.

        <OperatingSystemTabs>
          <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
            ```text
            python3 -m venv c:\path\to\virtual\environment
            ```
          </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

    1. Activate your new environment.

         <OperatingSystemTabs>
           <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
             ```text
             c:\path\to\virtual\environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
             ```
           </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

1. [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
1. Install the following packages.

      <Admonition type="note">
          Periodically rerun these commands or check the [Qiskit release notes](https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html) and the [Qiskit Runtime release notes](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/ibm-runtime/release_notes.html) so that you always have the latest versions. 
      </Admonition>

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit
      ```

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
      ```

      Run `pip list` to see the active packages in your virtual environment.

      If you intend to use visualization functionality or Jupyter notebooks, it is recommended to install Qiskit with the extra visualization support. Note that **zsh users** need to put `'qiskit[visualization]'` in single quotes.

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit[visualization]
      ```
      zsh users:

      ```shell
      pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'
      ```

If you are planning to work locally and use simulators built into Qiskit, then your installation is done. If you want to run jobs on IBM Quantum systems, next [select an access channel](setup-channel) and finish your setup.

## Operating system support

Qiskit strives to support as many operating systems as possible, but due to limitations in available testing resources and operating system availability, not all operating systems can be supported. Operating system support for Qiskit is broken into three tiers with different levels of support for each tier. For operating systems outside these, Qiskit is probably still installable, but it is not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely Qiskitâ€™s dependencies) from source.

Additionally, Qiskit only supports CPython. Running with other Python interpreters is not supported.

### Tier 1

Tier 1 operating systems are fully tested as part of the development processes to ensure any proposed change will function correctly. Pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process. Typically, as long as there is a functioning Python environment installed, Qiskit can be installed on these operating systems without needing to install further dependencies.

Tier 1 operating systems:

- Linux x86_64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification).
- macOS x86_64 (10.9 or later)
- Windows 64 bit

### Tier 2

Tier 2 operating systems are not tested as part of development process. However, pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process and these packages can be expected to be installed with just a functioning Python environment.

Tier 2 operating systems:

- Linux i686 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification) for Python releases earlier than 3.10
- Windows 32 bit for Python releases earlier than 3.10
- Linux AArch64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)

### Tier 3

Tier 3 operating systems are not tested as part of the development process. Pre-compiled binaries are built and published to PyPI as part of the release process but are not tested. They may not be installable with just a functioning Python environment and might require a C/C++ compiler or additional programs to build dependencies from source as part of the installation process. Support for these operating systems are best effort only.

Tier 3 operating systems:

- Linux ppc64le (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/)packaging specification)
- Linux s390x (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
- macOS ARM64 (10.15 or newer)
- Linux i686 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification) for Python 3.10 or later
- Windows 32 bit for Python 3.10 or later
