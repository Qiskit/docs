# Install and set up

Whether you will work locally or in a cloud environment, the first step for all users is to [install Qiskit](#local). For those wanting to run on a real backend, your next step will be to choose one of two channels in order to access IBM Quantum systems: IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Cloud. See [Select an IBM Quantum channel](#select) for more information.

<span id="local"></span>
## Install and set up Qiskit

1. Install Python. Check the requirements in the [setup.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/setup.py) file to determine which Python versions are supported.  For download instructions, see the [Python Beginners Guide.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

    We recommend that you use [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to separate Qiskit from other applications.  We also recommend that you use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) development environment to interact with Qiskit.

    1. Create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it.

        <OperatingSystemTabs>
          <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
            ```text
            python3 -m venv c:\path\to\virtual\environment
            ```
          </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

    1. Activate your new environment.

         <OperatingSystemTabs>
           <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
             ```text
             c:\path\to\virtual\environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
             ```
           </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

1. [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
1. Install the following packages.

      <Admonition type="note">
          Periodically rerun these commands or check the [Qiskit release notes](https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html) and the [Qiskit Runtime release notes](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/ibm-runtime/release_notes.html) so that you always have the latest versions. 
      </Admonition>

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit
      ```

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
      ```

      Run `pip list` to see the active packages in your virtual environment.

      If you intend to use visualization functionality or Jupyter notebooks, it is recommended to install Qiskit with the extra visualization support. Note that **zsh users** need to put `'qiskit[visualization]'` in single quotes.

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit[visualization]
      ```
      zsh users:

      ```shell
      pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'
      ```

If you are planning to work locally and use simulators built into Qiskit, then your installation is done. If you would like to run jobs on IBM Quantum systems, continue reading to select an access channel and finish your setup.

## Select an IBM Quantum channel
You can access IBM Quantum systems by using the IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Cloud channel.

### IBM Quantum Platform

IBM Quantum Platform has Open (free access) and Premium (contract-based paid access) plans. See [IBM Quantum access plans](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/access-plans) for details.

You can make requests locally (on your laptop or other device) using the `qiskit-ibm-runtime` SDK or use a cloud-based environment, such as [IBM Quantum Lab](https://lab.quantum-computing.ibm.com) (a Jupyter Notebook environment) or [IBM Quantum Composer](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/files/new) (a virtual circuit composer). To make requests from a local environment, you need to [install and set up Qiskit](#local) and [set up to use IBM Quantum Platform.](#iqp)

<Admonition type="note">
    [IBM Quantum Lab](https://lab.quantum-computing.ibm.com) and [IBM Quantum Composer](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/files/new) are self-contained tools and require no setup.
</Admonition>

Available plans: 

* **Open Plan** - Run your quantum circuits for free on real quantum systems.

* **Premium Plan** - Access our most powerful systems, as well as exploratory systems, with shorter wait times and hands-on service. Create and execute quantum programs at scale with Qiskit Runtime.

Visit [IBM Quantum access plans](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/access-plans) for further details.


### IBM Cloud

IBM Cloud offers a cloud-native service that is ideal if users need to integrate quantum capabilities with other cloud services.

IBM Cloud has Lite (free access) and Standard (pay-as-you-go access) plans. See [Qiskit Runtime plans](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-plans) on IBM Cloud for details.

This channel does not support a cloud-based development environment. Therefore, you will need to [install and set up Qiskit](#local) and [set up to use IBM Cloud.](#cloud)

Available plans:

- **Standard (Pay-as-you-go) Plan** - Access the more advanced systems with Qiskit Runtime on an as-needed basis, paying only for the time you use on real quantum systems (simulators are always free). Visit [IBM Quantum access plans](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/access-plans) for further details.

- **Lite plan**: Free simulators-only plan to help you get started with Qiskit Runtime. Learn to use Qiskit Runtime by following our examples and tutorials for one of the pre-built programs available for running circuits efficiently.

## Set up to use IBM Quantum Platform

You need access credentials to use cloud-based IBM Quantum systems. 

1. If you do not already have a user account, get one at the [IBM Quantum login page.](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login)  Your user account is associated with one or more [instances](../run/instances) (in the form hub / group / project) that give access to IBM Quantum services. Additionally, a unique token is assigned to each account, allowing for IBM Quantum access from Qiskit. The instructions in this section use our default instance.  For instructions to choose a specific instance, see [Connect to an instance](../run/instances#connect-instance). 

    <Admonition type="note">
      The Instances section in your [IBM Quantum account page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/account) lists the instances that you can access.
    </Admonition>

1. Retrieve your IBM Quantum token from the [IBM Quantum account page,](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/account) then start Python. For example:

    ```shell
    python3
    ```

1. Optionally use the `save_account()` method to save your credentials for easy access, as shown in the code block.

    * If you save your credentials to disk, you can use `QiskitRuntimeService()` in the future to initialize your account. The `channel` parameter distinguishes between different account types. If you are saving multiple accounts per channel, consider using the `name` parameter to differentiate them. 
    * If you are saving multiple accounts per channel, consider using the `name` parameter to differentiate them. 
    * Credentials are saved to `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json`.  Do not manually edit this file. 
    * If you don't save your credentials, you must specify them every time you start a new session. 
    * The `channel` parameter allows you to distinguish between different account types. When initializing the account, IBM Cloud is the default account used if have saved credentials for an IBM Quantum Platform and an IBM Cloud account.

    <Admonition type="important">
      Account credentials are saved in plain text, so only do so if you are using a trusted device.
    </Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">
IBM Cloud is the default account used if you don't specify a different channel or account name. 
</Admonition>

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# Save an IBM Quantum account.
QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<MY_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN>")
```

1. Authenticate to the service by calling `QiskitRuntimeService` with your saved credentials or with your IBM Cloud API key and CRN:

   ```python
   from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

   # Use this command if you didn't save your credentials:
   # service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<MY_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN>")

   # Load saved credentials
   service = QiskitRuntimeService()

   ```

1. Test your setup.  Run a simple circuit using Sampler to ensure that your environment is set up properly:

   ```python
   from qiskit.test.reference_circuits import ReferenceCircuits
   from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler

    # You'll need to specify the credentials when initializing QiskitRuntimeService, if they were not previously saved.
    service = QiskitRuntimeService()
    backend = service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
    job = Sampler(backend).run(ReferenceCircuits.bell())
    print(f"job id: {job.job_id()}")
    result = job.result()
    print(result)
    ```

 <span id="cloud"></span>
## Set up to use IBM Cloud

1. Start Python. For example:

    ```shell
    python3
    ```
1. If you do not already have one, set up an IBM Cloud account from the [IBM Cloud Registration page](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration).
1. Create a service instance, if necessary. Open your [IBM Cloud Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances). If you have one or more instances shown, continue to the next step. Otherwise, click **Create instance**, then agree to the license agreements by checking the box in the bottom right corner of the page, and click **Create**.

    <Admonition type="note">
      If you are an administrator who needs to set up Qiskit Runtime on Cloud for your organization, refer to [Plan Qiskit Runtime for an organization](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-quickstart-org).
    </Admonition>

1. Find your access credentials.
    1. Find your API key. From the [API keys page](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys), view or create your API key, then copy it to a secure location so you can use it for authentication.
    2. Find your Cloud Resource Name (CRN). Open the [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances) and click your instance. In the page that opens, click the icon to copy your CRN. Save it in a secure location so you can use it for authentication.

1. Optionally  use the save_account() method to save your credentials for easy access (see below).

    * If you save your credentials to disk, you can use `QiskitRuntimeService()` in the future to initialize your account. The `channel` parameter distinguishes between different account types. When initializing the account, IBM Cloud is the default account used if have saved credentials for an IBM Quantum Platform and an IBM Cloud account.
    * If you are saving multiple accounts per channel, consider using the `name` parameter to differentiate them. 
    * Credentials are saved to `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json`.  Do not manually edit this file. 
    * If you don't save your credentials, you must specify them every time you start a new session. 

    <Admonition type="important">
        Account credentials are saved in plain text, so only do so if you are using a trusted device.
    </Admonition>

    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    # Save account to disk. 
    QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_cloud", token="<IBM Cloud API key>", instance="<IBM Cloud CRN>", name="<account-name>")
    ```

    For more information about managing your account, see the [account management topic](../run/account-management).

1. Authenticate to the service by calling `QiskitRuntimeService` with your saved credentials or with your IBM Cloud API key and CRN:

   ```python
   from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

   # Use this command if you didn't save your credentials:
   # service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_cloud", token="<IBM Cloud API key>", instance="<IBM Cloud CRN>")

   # Load saved credentials
   service = QiskitRuntimeService(name="<account-name>")

   ```

 1. Test your setup.  Run a simple circuit using Sampler to ensure that your environment is set up properly:

   ```python
   from qiskit.test.reference_circuits import ReferenceCircuits
   from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler

    # You'll need to specify the credentials when initializing QiskitRuntimeService, if they were not previously saved.
    service = QiskitRuntimeService()
    backend = service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
    job = Sampler(backend).run(ReferenceCircuits.bell())
    print(f"job id: {job.job_id()}")
    result = job.result()
    print(result)
    ```
