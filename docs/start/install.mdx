# Install and set up Qiskit

Whether you will work locally or in a cloud environment, the first step for all users is to install Qiskit. For those wanting to run on a real backend, your next step is to choose one of two channels in order to access IBM Quantum systems: IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Cloud. 

<span id="local"></span>
## Install and set up Qiskit with the Qiskit Runtime Client

1. Install Python. Check the requirements in the [setup.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/setup.py) file to determine which Python versions are supported.  For download instructions, see the [Python Beginners Guide.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

    We recommend that you use [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to separate Qiskit from other applications.  We also recommend that you use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) development environment to interact with Qiskit.

    1. Create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it.

        <OperatingSystemTabs>
          <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
            ```text
            python3 -m venv c:\path\to\virtual\environment
            ```
          </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

    1. Activate your new environment.

         <OperatingSystemTabs>
           <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
             ```text
             c:\path\to\virtual\environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
             ```
           </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

1. [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
1. Install the following packages.

      <Admonition type="note">
          Periodically rerun these commands or check the [Qiskit release notes](../api/qiskit/release-notes) and the [Qiskit Runtime release notes](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes) so that you always have the latest versions. 
      </Admonition>

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit
      ```

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
      ```

      Run `pip list` to see the active packages in your virtual environment.

      If you intend to use visualization functionality or Jupyter notebooks, it is recommended to install Qiskit with the extra visualization support. Note that **zsh users** need to put `'qiskit[visualization]'` in single quotes.

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit[visualization]
      ```
      zsh users:

      ```shell
      pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'
      ```

If you are planning to work locally and use simulators built into Qiskit, then your installation is done. If you want to run jobs on IBM Quantum systems, next [select an access channel](setup-channel) and finish your setup.

## Operating system support

Qiskit strives to support as many operating systems as possible, but due to limitations in available testing resources and operating system availability, not all operating systems can be supported. Operating system support for Qiskit is broken into three tiers with different levels of support for each tier. For operating systems outside these, Qiskit is probably still installable, but it is not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely Qiskitâ€™s dependencies) from source.

Additionally, Qiskit only supports CPython. Running with other Python interpreters is not supported.

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 1
  </summary>
  Tier 1 operating systems are fully tested as part of the development processes to ensure any proposed change will function correctly. Pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process. Typically, as long as there is a functioning Python environment installed, Qiskit can be installed on these operating systems without needing to install further dependencies.

  Tier 1 operating systems:

  - Linux x86_64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification).
  - macOS x86_64 (10.12 or later)
  - Windows 64 bit
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 2
  </summary>
  Tier 2 operating systems are not tested as part of development process. However, pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process and these packages can be expected to be installed with just a functioning Python environment.

  Tier 2 operating systems:

  - Linux AArch64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 3
  </summary>
  Tier 3 operating systems are not tested as part of the development process. Pre-compiled binaries are built and published to PyPI as part of the release process but are not tested. They may not be installable with just a functioning Python environment and might require a C/C++ compiler or additional programs to build dependencies from source as part of the installation process. Support for these operating systems are best effort only.

  Tier 3 operating systems:

  - Linux ppc64le (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/)packaging specification)
  - Linux s390x (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
  - macOS ARM64 (10.15 or newer)
  - Linux i686 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
  - Windows 32 bit

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>
    "No Module 'qiskit'" error with Jupyter Notebook
  </summary>
  If you used ``pip install qiskit`` and set up your virtual environment in
  Anaconda, then you may get the ``No Module 'qiskit'`` error when you run a tutorial
  in Jupyter Notebook. If you have not installed Qiskit or set up your
  virtual environment, you can follow the [installation](#qiskit-install) steps.

  The error is caused when trying to import the Qiskit package in an
  environment where Qiskit is not installed. If you launched Jupyter Notebook
  from the Anaconda-Navigator, it is possible that Jupyter Notebook is running
  in the base (root) environment, instead of in your virtual
  environment. Choose a virtual environment in the Anaconda-Navigator from the
  **Applications on** dropdown menu. In this menu, you can see
  all of the virtual environments within Anaconda, and you can
  select the environment where you have Qiskit installed to launch Jupyter
  Notebook.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Compilation errors during installation
  </summary>
  Qiskit depends on a number of other open-source Python packages, which
  are automatically installed when doing ``pip install qiskit``. Depending on
  your system's platform and Python version, it is possible that a particular
  package does not provide pre-built binaries for your system. You can refer
  to [Operating system support](#operating-system-support) for a list of platforms supported by Qiskit, some
  of which may need an extra compiler. In cases where there are
  no precompiled binaries available, ``pip`` will attempt to compile the package
  from source, which in turn might require some extra dependencies that need to
  be installed manually.

  If the output of ``pip install qiskit`` contains similar lines to:

  ```
  Failed building wheel for SOME_PACKAGE
  ...
  build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/_openssl.c:498:30: fatal error
  compilation terminated.
  error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
  ```

  please check the documentation of the package that failed to install (in the
  example code, ``SOME_PACKAGE``) for information on how to install the libraries
  needed for compiling from source.

  -  [Select and set up an IBM Quantum channel.](setup-channel)
  -  [Configure Qiskit locally.](configure-qiskit-local)
  -  Follow the steps in [Hello world](hello-world) to write and run a quantum program.
