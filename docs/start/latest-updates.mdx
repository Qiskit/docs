# Latest updates

Keep up with the latest and greatest from Qiskit and IBM Quantum! Gathered here are the the most recent Qiskit package release summaries, documentation updates, blogs, community events, and more.

## Latest release summaries

{/* release summaries written by product owners */}

### Qiskit SDK v1.1.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit SDK release notes].
*
Qiskit SDK v1.1.0 has arrived, marking the first minor version release of the Qiskit SDK’s first major version. On the IBM Quantum&trade; blog, we review some of the key highlights — including top new features and improvements, as well as some important deprecations. Read the blog [here](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-1-1-release-summary).

The updates and improvements include the following:

- Updated `QuantumCircuit` objects that now support typed classical variables
- Improvements to the preset transpiler pass managers
- Speedups in transpilation runtime, thanks to our continued work re-writing transpiler passes in Rust
- A number of new transpiler passes, including `ElidePermutation` and `StarPreRouting`

Remember, because this a minor release, it will not introduce breaking changes for users moving from Qiskit SDK v1.0. Any deprecations announced with this release refer only to things that will now start throwing deprecation warnings. None of these will be removed until the release of Qiskit v2.0, pursuant to Qiskit’s official [deprecation policy](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/DEPRECATION.md#).

For more details on any of the topics covered in the blog, be sure to check [the v1.1 release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes/1.1).

### Qiskit Runtime IBM Client 0.24.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit Runtime IBM Client release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes).*

**Highlights from the 0.24.0 (2024-06-10) version release**

#### Deprecation notes

- The `backend` and `session` parameters in `SamplerV2` and `EstimatorV2` are deprecated. You can use the new `mode` parameter instead.
- [`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.get_backend()`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#get_backend) is deprecated. You can use [`qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService.backend()`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#backend) instead.
- The V1 fake backends, `FakeBackend`, and FakeProvider are deprecated in favor of the V2 fake backends and [`FakeProviderForBackendV2`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider.FakeProviderForBackendV2).

#### New features

- The [`ZneOptions.amplifier`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.ZneOptions#amplifier) option was added, which can be one of: `gate_folding` (default), `gate_folding_front`, and `gate_folding_back`. See the [API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.ZneOptions#zneoptions) for more details.
- You can now use the experimental option in [`qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.EstimatorOptions`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.EstimatorOptions) to enable the Probabilistic Error Amplification (PEA) error mitigation method.

#### Upgrade notes

- Qiskit SDK v1.1 is now supported and required.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed an issue where retrieved jobs would only return `RuntimeJob` instances, even if the job was run with a V2 primitive. Now, V2 primitive jobs will be returned correctly as `RuntimeJobV2` instances.
- Fixed the combination of `insert_multiple_cycles` and `coupling_map` options in [`PadDynamicalDecoupling`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.transpiler.passes.scheduling.PadDynamicalDecoupling). This combination allows to select staggered dynamical decoupling with multiple sequence cycles in each delay that crosses the threshold set by `sequence_min_length_ratios`.
- Fixed measurement twirling docstring that incorrectly indicated it’s enabled by default for Sampler.
- Fixed issues related to target generation and calibration data.

### Qiskit Transpiler Service Client v0.3.0

We’re pleased to share that the beta release of the Qiskit Transpiler Service is now available to all IBM Quantum&trade; Premium Plan users.

The Qiskit Transpiler Service leverages the resources of IBM Cloud&reg; to provide users with the latest transpilation capabilities from the Qiskit SDK. It offers a Python library that helps users seamlessly integrate the service into their current Qiskit patterns and workflows. Perhaps most importantly, the service invites users to experiment with new and improved AI-powered transpiler passes — cutting-edge tools that might be faster and produce better results than traditional transpilation methods.

On the IBM Quantum blog, we take a deep dive into the new beta release with a special focus on the new AI-powered passes. The blog includes detailed explanations showing how to use the Qiskit Transpiler Service for both full circuit transpilation and standalone AI-powered passes, with code examples for each. [Take a look.](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/ai-transpiler-passes)

## Qiskit IBM Runtime service updates

This summary of the latest changes to the Qiskit Runtime service applies to anyone using Qiskit Runtime, regardless of how you communicate with the service (using qiskit-ibm-runtime or otherwise), or which version of the client SDK you use. 

### 28 March 2024

Qiskit Runtime primitives now support QASM 3 as the input format for circuits and standard JSON output format. See [Qiskit IBM Runtime REST API](/api/runtime) for examples.

### 3 June 2024

Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available as an experimental option for Estimator V2. See the [`EstimatorOptions` API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.EstimatorOptions) for more details.

### 18 June 2024

The `optimization_level` option is deprecated for Estimator V2 and will be removed no sooner than three months from now.


## Qiskit blog: How execution modes enable efficient, utility-scale workloads 

{/* Bring over the Quantum news (blog) announcement post */}

*Browse all blogs at the [Quantum Research blog page](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog).*

In a recent post on the IBM Quantum&trade; blog, we introduce three new and improved execution modes that make running utility-scale workloads more reliable, more predictable, and more efficient than ever before.

Execution modes are the rules and procedures that govern how a user’s quantum circuits run on classical and quantum resources. When IBM put the first quantum computer in the cloud in 2016, users could only execute circuits as individual jobs. Since then, we’ve been working to see how execution modes can optimize the user experience even further.

After previewing them at the IBM Quantum Summit, we're thrilled to share more details on three execution modes that give users more flexibility in choosing how their circuits should be grouped together or divided up for optimal execution. These include **job mode** for running standalone jobs, **batch mode** for running non-iterative multi-job workloads, and **session mode** for running iterative workloads as a single experiment.

For more details on the new and improved execution modes, including example code that demonstrates batch mode and session mode, see [the full blog post](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/execution-modes).

Improvements to API reference documentation readability:
- Module pages make better use of headers to express the information hierarchy
