### Qiskit SDK

Qiskit SDK v1.1.0 has arrived, marking the first minor version release of the Qiskit SDK’s first major version. On the IBM Quantum&trade; blog, we review some of the key highlights — including top new features and improvements, as well as some important deprecations. Read the blog [here](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-1-1-release-summary).

The updates and improvements include the following:

- Updated `QuantumCircuit` objects that now support typed classical variables
- Improvements to the preset transpiler pass managers
- Speedups in transpilation runtime, thanks to our continued work re-writing transpiler passes in Rust
- A number of new transpiler passes, including `ElidePermutation` and `StarPreRouting`

Remember, because this a minor release, it will not introduce breaking changes for users moving from Qiskit SDK v1.0. Any deprecations announced with this release refer only to things that will now start throwing deprecation warnings. None of these will be removed until the release of Qiskit v2.0, pursuant to Qiskit’s official [deprecation policy](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/DEPRECATION.md#).

For more details on any of the topics covered in the blog, be sure to check [the v1.1 release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes/1.1).

### Qiskit Runtime IBM Client

**New features**

*   Related to the execution modes, Sampler and Estimator now include a `mode` argument. The `mode` parameter can be a Backend, Session, Batch, or None. As a result, the backend name has been deprecated, and will no longer be supported as a valid execution mode.

*   The ZneOptions.amplifier option was added, which can be one of these strings:

    *   `"gate_folding"` (default) uses 2-qubit gate folding to amplify noise. If the noise factor requires amplifying only a subset of the gates, then these gates are chosen randomly.
    *   `"gate_folding_front"` uses 2-qubit gate folding to amplify noise. If the noise factor requires amplifying only a subset of the gates, then these gates are selected from the front of the topologically ordered DAG circuit.
    *   `"gate_folding_back"` uses 2-qubit gate folding to amplify noise. If the noise factor requires amplifying only a subset of the gates, then these gates are selected from the back of the topologically ordered DAG circuit.

*   When saving an account, there is a new parameter, `private_endpoint` that if set to `True`, allows users to connect to a private IBM Cloud API. This parameter can also be used when the service is initialized, for example: `QiskitRuntimeService(private_endpoint = True)`.

*   New opt-in feature to support fractional gates is added to [`IBMBackend`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMBackend#run). IBM backends currently support dynamic circuits and fractional gates exclusively and the two features cannot be used in the same primitive job. In addition, some error mitigation protocols you can use with the estimator primitive, such as PEC or PEA, may not support gate twirling with the fractional gates. Since Qiskit Target model doesn’t represent such constraint, we adopted the opt-in approach, where your backend target includes only fractional gates (control flow instructions) when the backend is (not) opted. This feature is controlled when you retrieve the target backend from the [`QiskitRuntimeService`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService).

    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    backend = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum").backends(
        "name_of_your_backend",
        use_fractional_gates=True,
    )[0]
    ```

    When the fractional feature is enabled, transpiled circuits may have shorter depth compared with the conventional IBM basis gates, e.g. \[sx, rz, ecr].

    When you use control flow instructions, e.g. `if_else`, in your circuit, you must disable the fractional gate feature to get executable ISA circuits. The choice of the instruction set is now responsibility of users.

    Note that this pattern may be modified or removed without deprecation when the IBM backends is updated in future development.

*   You can now use the experimental option in [`qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.EstimatorOptions`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.EstimatorOptions) to enable Probabilistic Error Amplification (PEA) error mitigation method for your estimator jobs.

*   Qiskit version `1.1` is now supported and required.

### Qiskit Transpiler Service Client

We’re pleased to share that the beta release of the Qiskit Transpiler Service is now available to all IBM Quantum&trade; Premium Plan users.

The Qiskit Transpiler Service leverages the resources of IBM Cloud&reg; to provide users with the latest transpilation capabilities from the Qiskit SDK. It offers a Python library that helps users seamlessly integrate the service into their current Qiskit patterns and workflows. Perhaps most importantly, the service invites users to experiment with new and improved AI-powered transpiler passes — cutting-edge tools that might be faster and produce better results than traditional transpilation methods.

On the IBM Quantum blog, we take a deep dive into the new beta release with a special focus on the new AI-powered passes. The blog includes detailed explanations showing how to use the Qiskit Transpiler Service for both full circuit transpilation and standalone AI-powered passes, with code examples for each. [Take a look.](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/ai-transpiler-passes)

## Recent Quantum blogs {/* or just "Recent Quantum blog"? */}

{/* Point to just the latest blog, copying over the Quantum news announcement post advertising it??? - or more than just the latest? */}

In a recent post on the IBM Quantum&trade; blog, we introduce three new and improved execution modes that make running utility-scale workloads more reliable, more predictable, and more efficient than ever before.

Execution modes are the rules and procedures that govern how a user’s quantum circuits run on classical and quantum resources. When IBM put the first quantum computer in the cloud in 2016, users could only execute circuits as individual jobs. Since then, we’ve been working to see how execution modes can optimize the user experience even further.

After previewing them at the IBM Quantum Summit, we're thrilled to share more details on three execution modes that give users more flexibility in choosing how their circuits should be grouped together or divided up for optimal execution. These include **job mode** for running standalone jobs, **batch mode** for running non-iterative multi-job workloads, and **session mode** for running iterative workloads as a single experiment.

For more details on the new and improved execution modes, including example code that demonstrates batch mode and session mode, see [the full blog post](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/execution-modes).
