# Introduction

The quantum community has explored quantum computing on the cloud since 2016.  Now the community has a new challenge: *demonstrate useful quantum computation*. To support this challenge, IBM Quantum systems provide the necessary tools to usher in the era of quantum utility: scale, quality, and speed. Whether you try out a no-cost plan or run your programs through a pay-as-you-go or premium plan, you can start doing useful work with quantum computing.


Through IBM Quantum, you have access to: 

- **Performant and utility-scale (>100-qubit) quantum systems**. 
  IBM Quantum maintains the world’s most advanced fleet of quantum systems, with seven [utility-scale](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/new-ibm-quantum-systems-on-the-ibm-cloud/) quantum systems, and more on the way. These systems demonstrate unparalleled reliability, with >95% uptime across the fleet of quantum systems - and unmatched stability, with two-qubit gate error fluctuations no larger than 0.001 over timescales measured in months[^1].



- **Scalable and flexible quantum software**. 
  IBM Quantum is committed to open-source innovation. Preferred by 81% of quantum programmers[^2], the Qiskit software development kit works with eight different hardware manufacturers, making it the lingua franca of quantum computing, and its circuit optimization is the most advanced (seven times faster utility-scale circuit transpilation than competing frameworks). Build quantum circuits and operators in Qiskit, the transpile and run on quantum systems using primitives, a simplified interface for circuit execution. When you pair Qiskit with Qiskit Runtime, you'll benefit from seamless circuit execution powered by advanced runtime compilation, error suppression, and error mitigation techniques.  


There are six sections at the core of our documentation, based on the stages of a typical quantum user’s journey. If you’re just getting started with IBM Quantum, you are in the right place. Use the topics in this section to get ready, then proceed to [Build](../build) to create your first quantum circuit. Keep working through the sections in order, following the tabs at the top of this page.

Already know what you’re looking for?

- [Install](install): Begin using our tools and platforms with install and setup instructions.

- [Build](../build): Design and develop quantum circuits with primitives and advanced methods like dynamic circuits and mid-circuit measurements. You can also find our circuit library here.

- [Test](../test): Verify and evaluate your quantum circuits.

- [Run](../run): Run on our hardware with job configuration options such as sessions.

- [Optimize](../optimize): Find options here to tweak your job, from tuning primitive options, to error suppression and mitigation.

- **API reference**: Find API references for [Qiskit](/api/qiskit), [Qiskit Runtime IBM Client](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/runtime_service), [Qiskit IBM Runtime Rest API](/api/runtime/tags/programs), and [Qiskit IBM Provider](/api/qiskit-ibm-provider/ibm_provider) in the API reference drop-down menu above.


{/* Add back in when we have guides:
- [Guides](../guides): Go here for walkthroughs of advanced methods drawn from real research and use cases.*/}
