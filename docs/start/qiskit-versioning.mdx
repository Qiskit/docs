# Qiskit Versioning
Qiskit version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
The version number is comprised of 3 primary components, the major, minor, and
patch versions. For a version number `X.Y.Z` where `X` is the major version,
`Y` is the minor version, and `Z` is the patch version.

Breaking API changes are reserved for major version releases. The **minimum**
period between major version releases is one year. Minor versions will be
periodically (currently every three months) published for the current major
version which add new features and bug fixes. For the most recent minor version
there will also be new patch versions published as bugs are identified and fixed
on that release series. A tentative release schedule is included below:

For an up-to-date release schedule you should refer to the Qiskit Github project's
[milestones list](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/milestones) which will always
contain the current release plan.

With the release of a new major version, the previous major version is supported
for at least 6 months; only bug and security fixes will be accepted during this
time and only patch releases will be published for this major version. A final
patch version will be published when support is dropped and that release will
also document the end of support for that major version series. A longer
support window is needed for the previous major version as this gives downstream
consumers of Qiskit a chance to migrate not only their code but also their
users. It's typically not recommended for a downstream library that
depends on Qiskit to bump its minimum Qiskit version to a new
major version release immediately because its user base also needs a chance
to migrate to the new API changes. Having an extended support window
for the previous major Qiskit version gives downstream projects time to fix
compatibility with the next major version. Downstream projects can provide
support for two release series at a time to give their users a migration path.





For the purposes of semantic versioning, the Qiskit public API is considered
any documented module, class, function, or method that is not marked as private
(with a `_` prefix). However, there can be explicit exceptions made in the case
of specific documented APIs. In such cases these will be clearly documented as
either not being considered stable interfaces yet and a warning will be actively
emitted on the use of these unstable interface. In some situations an interface
marked as private will be considered part of the public API, these
Typically this only occurs in two cases, either an abstract interface definition
where subclasses are intended to override/implement a private method as part of
defining an implementation of the interface, or advanced-usage low-level methods
that have stable interfaces but are not considered safe to use as the burden
is on the user to uphold the class/safety invariants themselves (the canonical
example of this is the `QuantumCircuit._append` method)

The supported Python versions, minimum supported Rust version (for building
Qiskit from source), and any Python package dependencies (including the minimum
supported versions of dependencies) used by Qiskit are not part of the backwards
compatibility guarantees and may change during any release. Only minor or major
version releases will raise minimum requirements for using or building Qiskit
(including adding new dependencies), but patch fixes might include support for
new versions of Python or other dependencies. Usually the minimum version of a
dependency is only increased when older dependency versions go out of support or
when it is not possible to maintain compatibility with the latest release of the
dependency and the older version.

## Upgrade Strategy

Whenever a new major version is released the recommended upgrade path
is to first upgrade to use the most recent minor version on the previous major
version. Immediately preceding a new major version a final minor version will
be published. This final minor version release `M.N+1.0` is equivalent to
`M.N.0` but with warnings and deprecations for any API changes that are
made on the new major version series.

For example, on the release of Qiskit 1.0.0 a 0.46.0 release was published
immediately proceeding the 1.0.0 release. The 0.46.0 release was equivalent
to the 0.45.0 release but with additional deprecation warnings that document
the API changes that were made as part of the 1.0.0 release. This pattern
will be used for any future major version releases.

As a user of Qiskit it's recommended that you first upgrade to this final minor
version first, so you can see any deprecation warnings and adjust your Qiskit
usage ahead of time before trying a potentially breaking release. The previous
major version will be supported for at least 6 months to give sufficient time
to upgrade. A typical pattern to deal with this is to pin the max version to
avoid using the next major release series until you're sure of compatibility.
For example, specifying in a requirements file `qiskit<2` when the current
major Qiskit version is 1 will ensure that you're using a version of Qiskit
that won't have breaking API changes.

Pre-emptively capping the version less than the next major version is necessary
to ensure you get a chance to see deprecation warnings before a
major version release. The normal release schedule means the last minor
version release which includes any final deprecation warnings will be released
at the same time as the next major version and `pip` will default to using
the newest version available unless the version cap is set.

<span id="pre-releases"></span>
## Pre-releases

For each minor and major version release Qiskit will publish pre-releases that
are compatible with `PEP440 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/>`__. Typically
these are just release candidates of the form `1.2.0rc1`. The `rc` releases
will have a finalized API surface and are used to test a prospective release.

If another PEP440 pre-release suffix (such as `a`, `b`, or `pre`) are
published these do not have the same guarantees as an `rc` release, and are
just preview releases. The API likely will change between these pre-releases
and the final release with that version number. For example, `1.0.0pre1` has
a different final API from `1.0.0`.

<span id="post-releases"></span>
## Post-releases

If there are issues with the packaging of a given release a post-release may be
issued to correct this. These will follow the form `1.2.1.1` where the fourth
integer is used to indicate it is the 1st post release of the `1.2.1` release.
For example, the qiskit-terra (the legacy package name for Qiskit) 0.25.2
release had some issue with the sdist package publishing and a post-release
0.25.2.1 was published that corrected this issue. The code was identical, and
0.25.2.1 just fixed the packaging issue for the release.
