# Local Qiskit configuration

After Qiskit is installed and running, there are some optional steps you can take to change the default Qiskit behavior.

## User configuration file

The main location for local configuration of Qiskit is the user configuration file. This is an .ini format file that can be used to change Qiskit default settings.

For example:

 ```text
[default]
circuit_drawer = mpl
circuit_mpl_style = default
circuit_mpl_style_path = ~:~/.qiskit
state_drawer = hinton
transpile_optimization_level = 3
parallel = False
num_processes = 15
 ```

By default this file is in `~/.qiskit/settings.conf` but the path can be overridden with the QISKIT_SETTINGS environment variable.

## Available options

- `circuit_drawer`: Changes the default backend for the circuit drawer :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`. It can be set to `latex`, `mpl`, `text`, or `latex_source`. When the output kwarg is not explicitly set, that drawer backend will be used.
- `circuit_mpl_style`: The default style sheet used for the mpl output backend for the circuit drawer :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` and :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`. It can be set to `default` or `bw`.
- `circuit_mpl_style_path`: The paths to have the circuit drawer, :meth:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.draw` or :func:`qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer`, use to look for JSON style sheets when using the mpl output mode.
- `state_drawer`: This is used to change the default backend for the state visualization draw methods :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector.draw` and :meth:`qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix.draw`. It can be set to `repr`, `text`, `latex`, `latex_source`, `qsphere`, `hinton`, or `bloch` and when the output kwarg is not explicitly set on the :meth:`~qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix.draw` method, that output method will be used.
- `transpile_optimization_level`: Change the default optimization level for :func:`~qiskit.compiler.transpile` and :func:`~qiskit.execute.execute`. The value is an integer 0-3.
- `parallel`: Whether Python multiprocessing is enabled for operations that support running in parallel, for example, transpilation of multiple :class:`~qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` objects. This setting can be overridden by the QISKIT_PARALLEL environment variable. This takes a boolean value.
- `num_processes`: The maximum number of parallel processes to launch for parallel operations if parallel execution is enabled. This setting can be overridden by the QISKIT_NUM_PROCS environment variable. This option takes an integer greater than 0. 

## Environment variables

There are also a few environment variables that can be set to alter the default behavior of Qiskit.

- QISKIT_PARALLEL: Enables Python multiprocessing to parallelize certain operations, for example, transpilation over multiple circuits in Qiskit. This takes a boolean value.
- QISKIT_NUM_PROCS: The maximum number of parallel processes to launch for parallel operations if parallel execution is enabled. This takes an integer greater than zero.
- RAYON_NUM_THREADS: The number of threads to run multithreaded operations in Qiskit. By default this multithreaded code will launch a thread for each logical CPU, if you'd like to adjust the number of threads Qiskit will use you can set this to an integer value. For example, setting RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4 will only launch four threads for multithreaded functions. 
- QISKIT_FORCE_THREADS: Specifies that multithreaded code should always execute in multiple threads. By default if you're running multithreaded code in a section of Qiskit that is already running in parallel processes, Qiskit will not launch multiple threads and instead executes that function serially. This is done to avoid potentially overloading limited CPU resources. However, if you want to force the use of multiple threads even when in a multiprocess context, you can set QISKIT_FORCE_THREADS=TRUE.
