# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

For FAQs specific to the execution modes, see the [Qiskit Runtime execution modes FAQ](/guides/execution-modes-faq) guide.

## How do I cite Qiskit in my research?

Cite Qiskit by using the included [BibTeX file](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/CITATION.bib).

## How do I cite an IBM Quantum computer in my research?

For research papers, we encourage authors to acknowledge IBM Quantum&trade; by using:

>    We acknowledge the use of IBM Quantum services for this work. The views expressed are those of the authors, and do not reflect the official policy or position of IBM or the IBM Quantum team.

Paper references should be cited as follows:

> IBM Quantum. https://<span>quantum.ibm.com</span>/, 2021

Quantum processing units in the paper should be referenced by their unique name (for example, `ibmq_vigo`) and optionally
adding the version (for example, `ibmq_vigo` v1.0.2).  We also encourage referencing the processor.
For example:

> In this paper we used `ibmq_vigo`, which is one of the IBM Quantum Canary processors.

An example of citing an IBM Quantum program:

> IBM Quantum (2022). Estimator primitive (Version x.y.z) [computer software]. https://<span>quantum.ibm.com</span>/

## How do I cite IBM Quantum Composer in my research?

An example of citing IBM Quantum Composer:

> IBM Quantum Composer. 2023. url: https://<span>quantum.ibm.com/composer</span>

## Why do I receive the error message "AttributeError: `QuantumCircuit` object has no attribute `save_state`" when using `save_*`method on a circuit?
  
The `save_*` instructions are part of Qiskit Aer project,
a high performance simulator for quantum circuits. These instructions do not
exist outside of Qiskit Aer and are added dynamically to the
[QuantumCircuit](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#quantumcircuit-class) class by Qiskit Aer on import. If you would like to
use these instructions you must first ensure that you have imported
`qiskit_aer` in your program before trying to call these methods. You
can refer to [qiskit_aer.library](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/apidocs/aer_library.html) for the details of these custom

## Why do my results from real devices differ from my results from the simulator?

The simulator models an ideal environment, without noise or decoherence. When jobs are run on the real devices, noise from the environment and decoherence cause the qubits to behave differently than in an ideal environment.

## How do I delete my account and data?

To delete your account, go to your [account page](https://quantum.ibm.com/account#delete-account). Scroll to the Delete Account section, and click *Delete your account and account data*. You will receive an email with a link to delete your account.

## Questions about cloud simulator retirement

To migrate from cloud simulators to local simulators, see the [migration guide](/migration-guides/local-simulators).

### Why are the cloud simulators being retired?

The cloud simulators are being retired for several reasons.

#### Simulators have limitations

Simulators can be useful, but they are too limited to use for research or experimentation:

- Simulators are valuable for understanding small-scale QPUs (quantum processing units), but their usefulness maxes out at around 50 qubits, even with access to high-performance supercomputers. This ceiling comes from the exponential growth in computational resources required to simulate larger quantum computers (review [Massively parallel quantum computer simulator, eleven years later](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04708) for the full explanation).  Exploring quantum computers of 100 qubits and more requires hardware.

- While some simulators offer noise models, it is a very hard problem to capture the entire dynamics of a real QPU. Quantum hardware offers the potential for researchers to confront the challenges inherent in quantum computers, such as noise, errors, and decoherence in a realistic testing environment.


#### Using quantum hardware builds unique skills

Interacting with quantum hardware grows skills and experience unattainable by only using simulators:

- Direct interaction with quantum hardware builds skills because you must implement or use error mitigation or suppression techniques, for reliable computation.

- Hands-on experience with quantum hardware develops a deeper understanding of quantum phenomena and how to tailor algorithms to the characteristics of quantum processors.

- Engaging with quantum hardware results in practical insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantum computing, enhancing developers' ability to drive innovation in the field.

#### Algorithms should be adapted for quantum hardware

Successful quantum algorithms must be adapted to exploit the capabilities of quantum hardware, optimizing performance and efficiency.

- Quantum hardware provides a more accurate representation of real-world QPUs than simulators.

- Fine-tuning algorithms for quantum hardware involves adjusting ansatz, circuit implementations, parameters, and configuration to maximize performance.  This process is best achieved through direct experimentation with quantum hardware.

### When should simulators be used?

Quantum simulators should be used to help develop and test programs before fine-tuning them and sending them to quantum hardware. Local simulators can do this with good performance and efficiency.  Clifford circuits can be simulated very efficiently, and results can be verified, which is a useful way to gain confidence in an experiment.

<Admonition type="note">
Local testing mode does not have built-in error suppression or mitigation.  Instead, you must specify those options explicitly. See [Configure error mitigation for Qiskit Runtime](/guides/configure-error-mitigation) for details.
