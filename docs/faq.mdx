    How do I cite an IBM Quantum computer in my research?
  </summary>

For research papers, we encourage authors to acknowledge IBM Quantum using:

>    We acknowledge the use of IBM Quantum services for this work. The views expressed are those of the authors, and do not reflect the official policy or position of IBM or the IBM Quantum team.

Paper references should be cited as follows:

> IBM Quantum. https://<span>quantum.ibm.com</span>/, 2021

Quantum processing units in the paper should be referenced by their unique name (i.e., `ibmq_vigo`) and optionally
adding the version (i.e., `ibmq_vigo` v1.0.2).  We also encourage referencing the processor.
For example:

> In this paper we used `ibmq_vigo`, which is one of the IBM Quantum Canary processors.

An example of citing an IBM Quantum program:

> IBM Quantum (2022). Estimator primitive (Version x.y.z) [computer software]. https://<span>quantum.ibm.com</span>/

    Why do I receive the error message `AttributeError: QuantumCircuit object has no attribute 'save_state'` when using `save_*`method on a circuit?
  </summary>
  
The `save_*` instructions are part of Qiskit Aer project,
a high performance simulator for quantum circuits. These instructions do not
exist outside of Qiskit Aer and are added dynamically to the
[QuantumCircuit](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#quantumcircuit-class) class by Qiskit Aer on import. If you would like to
use these instructions you must first ensure that you have imported
`qiskit_aer` in your program before trying to call these methods. You
can refer to [qiskit_aer.library](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/apidocs/aer_library.html) for the details of these custom
instructions included with Qiskit Aer.

    Why do my results from real devices differ from my results from the simulator?
  </summary>

The simulator models an ideal environment, without noise or decoherence. When jobs are run on the real devices, noise from the environment and decoherence cause the qubits to behave differently than in an ideal environment.
