# Qiskit Runtime local testing mode

Quantum simulators should be used to help develop and test programs before fine-tuning them and sending them to real quantum hardware. Local simulators can do this with good performance and efficiency.  Clifford circuits can be simulated very efficiently, and results can be verified. This is useful to give confidence in an experiment.

To use local testing mode with Qiskit Runtime, specify one of the fake backends in ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider`` or specify a Qiskit Aer backend when instantiating a primitive or a session.  For details, see the [fake_provider API reference.](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/fake_provider)

If you currently use Qiskit (and not Qiskit Runtime), you can use the existing Qiskit Aer primitives for local testing.  See [exact and noisy simulation with Qiskit Aer primitives](../verify/simulate-with-qiskit-aer) for details. 

Example:

```python
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit.circuit.library import RealAmplitudes
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session, SamplerV2 as Sampler
from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeManilaV2

# Bell Circuit
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

# Run the sampler job locally using FakeManilaV2
fake_manila = FakeManilaV2()
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=fake_manila, optimization_level=1)
isa_qc = pm.run(qc)
sampler = Sampler(backend=fake_manila)
result = sampler.run(isa_qc).result()

# Run the sampler job locally using AerSimulator.
# Session syntax is supported but ignored because simulators don't support sessions.
aer_sim = AerSimulator()
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=aer_sim, optimization_level=1)
isa_qc = pm.run(qc)
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
with Session(service=service, backend=aer_sim) as session:
    sampler = Sampler(session=session)
    result = sampler.run([(isa_qc)]).result()
```
