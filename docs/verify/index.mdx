# Introduction

In the verify phase, you test your quantum programs by running them on simulated devices and exploring their performance under realistic device [noise models](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/apidocs/aer_noise.html). This allows you to validate them before sending them to a physical system. This phase consists of the following steps:

1. Run your program on a quantum simulator, using [Qiskit reference primitives](simulate-with-primitives) or [IBM Quantum cloud-based simulators](simulators).
1. [Add noise to your simulation](noise). 
2. Optionally [create your own noise model](building_noise_models).
