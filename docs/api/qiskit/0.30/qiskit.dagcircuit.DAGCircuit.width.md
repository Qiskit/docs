# qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.width

`DAGCircuit.width()`

Return the total number of qubits + clbits used by the circuit. This function formerly returned the number of qubits by the calculation return len(self.\_wires) - self.num\_clbits() but was changed by issue #2564 to return number of qubits + clbits with the new function DAGCircuit.num\_qubits replacing the former semantic of DAGCircuit.width().
