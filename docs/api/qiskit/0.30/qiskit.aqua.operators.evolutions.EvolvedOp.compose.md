# qiskit.aqua.operators.evolutions.EvolvedOp.compose

`EvolvedOp.compose(other, permutation=None, front=False)`

Return Operator Composition between self and other (linear algebra-style: A\@B(x) = A(B(x))), overloaded by `@`.

Note: You must be conscious of Quantum Circuit vs. Linear Algebra ordering conventions. Meaning, X.compose(Y) produces an X∘Y on qubit 0, but would produce a QuantumCircuit which looks like

> -\[Y]-\[X]-

Because Terra prints circuits with the initial state at the left side of the circuit.

**Parameters**

*   **other** (`OperatorBase`) – The `OperatorBase` with which to compose self.
*   **permutation** (`Optional`\[`List`\[`int`]]) – `List[int]` which defines permutation on other operator.
*   **front** (`bool`) – If front==True, return `other.compose(self)`.

**Return type**

`OperatorBase`

**Returns**

An `OperatorBase` equivalent to the function composition of self and other.
