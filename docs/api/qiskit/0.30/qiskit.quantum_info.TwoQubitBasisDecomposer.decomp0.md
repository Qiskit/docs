# qiskit.quantum\_info.TwoQubitBasisDecomposer.decomp0

`static TwoQubitBasisDecomposer.decomp0(target)`

Decompose target \~Ud(x, y, z) with 0 uses of the basis gate. Result Ur has trace: $|Tr(Ur.Utarget^dag)| = 4|(cos(x)cos(y)cos(z)+ j sin(x)sin(y)sin(z)|$, which is optimal for all targets and bases
