# qiskit.aqua.operators.state\_fns.CircuitStateFn.to\_density\_matrix

`CircuitStateFn.to_density_matrix(massive=False)`

Return numpy matrix of density operator, warn if more than 16 qubits to force the user to set massive=True if they want such a large matrix. Generally big methods like this should require the use of a converter, but in this case a convenience method for quick hacking and access to classical tools is appropriate.

**Return type**

`ndarray`
