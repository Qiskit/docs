# qiskit.opflow\.OperatorBase.primitive\_strings

`abstract OperatorBase.primitive_strings()`

Return a set of strings describing the primitives contained in the Operator. For example, `{'QuantumCircuit', 'Pauli'}`. For hierarchical Operators, such as `ListOps`, this can help illuminate the primitives represented in the various recursive levels, and therefore which conversions can be applied.
