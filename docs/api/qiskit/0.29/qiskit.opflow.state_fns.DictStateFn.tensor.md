# qiskit.opflow\.state\_fns.DictStateFn.tensor

`DictStateFn.tensor(other)`

Return tensor product between self and other, overloaded by `^`. Note: You must be conscious of Qiskit’s big-endian bit printing convention. Meaning, Plus.tensor(Zero) produces a |+⟩ on qubit 0 and a |0⟩ on qubit 1, or |+⟩⨂|0⟩, but would produce a QuantumCircuit like

> |0⟩– |+⟩–

Because Terra prints circuits and results with qubit 0 at the end of the string or circuit.

**Parameters**

**other** (`OperatorBase`) – The `OperatorBase` to tensor product with self.

**Return type**

`OperatorBase`

**Returns**

An `OperatorBase` equivalent to the tensor product of self and other.
