# qiskit.ignis.verification.QVFitter.add\_statevectors

`QVFitter.add_statevectors(new_statevector_result)`

Add the ideal results and convert to the heavy outputs.

Assume the result is from ‘statevector\_simulator’

**Parameters**

**new\_statevector\_result** (*list*) – ideal results

**Raises**

**QiskitError** – If the result has already been added for the circuit
