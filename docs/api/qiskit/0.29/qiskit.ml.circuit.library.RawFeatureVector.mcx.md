`RawFeatureVector.mcx(control_qubits, target_qubit, ancilla_qubits=None, mode='noancilla')`

Apply [`MCXGate`](qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGate#qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGate "qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGate").

The multi-cX gate can be implemented using different techniques, which use different numbers of ancilla qubits and have varying circuit depth. These modes are: - ‘noancilla’: Requires 0 ancilla qubits. - ‘recursion’: Requires 1 ancilla qubit if more than 4 controls are used, otherwise 0. - ‘v-chain’: Requires 2 less ancillas than the number of control qubits. - ‘v-chain-dirty’: Same as for the clean ancillas (but the circuit will be longer).
