# qiskit.circuit.IfElseOp.c\_if

`IfElseOp.c_if(classical, val)`

Set a classical equality condition on this instruction between the register or cbit `classical` and value `val`.

<Admonition title="Note" type="note">
  This is a setter method, not an additive one. Calling this multiple times will silently override any previously set condition; it does not stack.
