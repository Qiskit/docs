# qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate.inverse

`PauliEvolutionGate.inverse()`

Invert this instruction.

If the instruction is composite (i.e. has a definition), then its definition will be recursively inverted.

Special instructions inheriting from Instruction can implement their own inverse (e.g. T and Tdg, Barrier, etc.)

**Returns**

a fresh instruction for the inverse

**Return type**

[qiskit.circuit.Instruction](qiskit.circuit.Instruction#qiskit.circuit.Instruction "qiskit.circuit.Instruction")

**Raises**

**CircuitError** â€“ if the instruction is not composite and an inverse has not been implemented for it.
