# qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.num\_tensor\_factors

`QuantumCircuit.num_tensor_factors()`

Computes the number of tensor factors in the unitary (quantum) part of the circuit only.

## Notes

This is here for backwards compatibility, and will be removed in a future release of Qiskit. You should call num\_unitary\_factors instead.

**Return type**

`int`
