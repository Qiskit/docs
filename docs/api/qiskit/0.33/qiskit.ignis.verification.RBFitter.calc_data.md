# qiskit.ignis.verification.RBFitter.calc\_data

`RBFitter.calc_data()`

Retrieve probabilities of success from execution results.

Outputs results into an internal variable \_raw\_data which is a 3-dimensional list, where item (i,j,k) is the probability to measure the ground state for the set of qubits in pattern “i” for seed no. j and vector length self.\_cliff\_lengths\[i]\[k].

## Additional information:

Assumes that the executed ‘result’ is the output of circuits generated by randomized\_benchmarking\_seq.
