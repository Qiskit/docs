# MSGate



`MSGate(num_qubits, theta, label=None)`

Bases: `qiskit.circuit.gate.Gate`

MSGate has been deprecated. Please use `GMS` in `qiskit.circuit.generalized_gates` instead.

Global Mølmer–Sørensen gate.

The Mølmer–Sørensen gate is native to ion-trap systems. The global MS can be applied to multiple ions to entangle multiple qubits simultaneously.

In the two-qubit case, this is equivalent to an XX(theta) interaction, and is thus reduced to the RXXGate.

Create new MS gate.
