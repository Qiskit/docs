  The number of remaining jobs for a backend is provider specific. For example, if you have access to the same backend via different providers, the number of remaining jobs might be different for each. See [`BackendJobLimit`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.BackendJobLimit#qiskit.providers.ibmq.BackendJobLimit "qiskit.providers.ibmq.BackendJobLimit") for the job limit information of a backend.

If `None` is returned, there are no limits to the maximum number of active jobs you could have on the backend.
