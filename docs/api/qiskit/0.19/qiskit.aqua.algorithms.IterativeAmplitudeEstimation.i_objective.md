# i\_objective

Get the index of the objective qubit. The objective qubit marks the |psi\_0> state (called ‘bad states’ in [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005055](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005055)) with |0> and |psi\_1> (‘good’ states) with |1>. If the A operator performs the mapping

> A |0>\_n |0> = sqrt\{1 - a} |psi\_0>\_n |0> + sqrt\{a} |psi\_1>\_n |1>

then, the objective qubit is the last one (which is either |0> or |1>).

If the objective qubit (i\_objective) is not set, we check if the Q operator (q\_factory) is set and return the index specified there. If the q\_factory is not defined, the index equals the number of qubits of the A operator (a\_factory) minus one. If also the a\_factory is not set, return None.

**Returns**

the index of the objective qubit

**Return type**

int
