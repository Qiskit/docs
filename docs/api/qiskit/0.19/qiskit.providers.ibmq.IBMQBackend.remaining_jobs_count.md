  The number of remaining jobs for a backend is provider specific.

See [`BackendJobLimit`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.BackendJobLimit "qiskit.providers.ibmq.BackendJobLimit") for the job limit information of a backend.
</Admonition>

If `None` is returned, there are no limits to the maximum number of active jobs you could have on the backend.

**Return type**

**Returns**

The remaining number of jobs a user could submit to the backend, with this provider, before the maximum limit on active jobs is reached.
