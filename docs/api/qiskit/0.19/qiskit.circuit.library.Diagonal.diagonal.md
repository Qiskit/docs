# diagonal

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.Diagonal.diagonal" />

`Diagonal.diagonal(diag, qubit)`

Attach a diagonal gate to a circuit.

The decomposition is based on Theorem 7 given in “Synthesis of Quantum Logic Circuits” by Shende et al. ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0406176.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0406176.pdf)).

**Parameters**

*   **diag** (*list*) – list of the 2^k diagonal entries (for a diagonal gate on k qubits). Must contain at least two entries
*   **qubit** ([*QuantumRegister*](qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister "qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister")*|list*) – list of k qubits the diagonal is acting on (the order of the qubits specifies the computational basis in which the diagonal gate is provided: the first element in diag acts on the state where all the qubits in q are in the state 0, the second entry acts on the state where all the qubits q\[1],…,q\[k-1] are in the state zero and q\[0] is in the state 1, and so on)

**Returns**

the diagonal gate which was attached to the circuit.

**Return type**

[QuantumCircuit](qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit")

**Raises**

**QiskitError** – if the list of the diagonal entries or the qubit list is in bad format; if the number of diagonal entries is not 2^k, where k denotes the number of qubits
