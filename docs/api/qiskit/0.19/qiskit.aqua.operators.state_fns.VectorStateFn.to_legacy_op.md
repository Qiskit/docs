`VectorStateFn.to_legacy_op(massive=False)`

Attempt to return the Legacy Operator representation of the Operator. If self is a `SummedOp` of `PauliOps`, will attempt to convert to `WeightedPauliOperator`, and otherwise will simply convert to `MatrixOp` and then to `MatrixOperator`. The Legacy Operators cannot represent `StateFns` or proper `ListOps` (meaning not one of the `ListOp` subclasses), so an error will be thrown if this method is called on such an Operator. Also, Legacy Operators cannot represent unbound Parameter coeffs, so an error will be thrown if any are present in self.

Warn if more than 16 qubits to force having to set `massive=True` if such a large vector is desired.

**Return type**

[`LegacyBaseOperator`](qiskit.aqua.operators.legacy.LegacyBaseOperator "qiskit.aqua.operators.legacy.base_operator.LegacyBaseOperator")

**Returns**

The `LegacyBaseOperator` representing this Operator.

**Raises**

**TypeError** â€“ self is an Operator which cannot be represented by a `LegacyBaseOperator`, such as `StateFn`, proper (non-subclass) `ListOp`, or an Operator with an unbound coeff Parameter.
