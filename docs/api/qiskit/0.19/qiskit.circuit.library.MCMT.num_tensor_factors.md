# num\_tensor\_factors

<span id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCMT.num_tensor_factors" />

`MCMT.num_tensor_factors()`

Computes the number of tensor factors in the unitary (quantum) part of the circuit only.

## Notes

This is here for backwards compatibility, and will be removed in a future release of Qiskit. You should call num\_unitary\_factors instead.
