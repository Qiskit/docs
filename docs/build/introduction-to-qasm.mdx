# Introduction to OpenQASM

OpenQASM (open quantum assembly language),  a machine-independent programming interface for IBM Quantum systems, is an imperative programming language for describing quantum circuits. OpenQASM uses the quantum circuit model to express quantum programs as ordered sequences of parameterized operations (such as gates, measurements, and resets) and real-time classical computation. In addition to quantum algorithms, OpenQASM can describe circuits intended to characterize, validate, or debug quantum systems.

As the needs of quantum system development have evolved, OpenQASM's feature list has expanded in response; the latest version, [OpenQASM 3,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14722) incorporates extensions including classical feed-forward flow control, gate modifiers, and pulse implementations. 

OpenQASM's versatility makes it an ideal interchange format among independent tools that otherwise would not be able to inter-operate. Qiskit provides ways to convert between OpenQASM and the [`QuantumCircuit`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) class (see [OpenQASM 2 and Qiskit](interoperate-qiskit-qasm2) and [OpenQASM 3 and Qiskit](interoperate-qiskit-qasm3) for instructions).
