# Interoperate Qiskit with OpenQASM 3

Qiskit provides some tools for converting between OpenQASM representations of quantum programs, and the QuantumCircuit class. Note these tools are still in an exploratory phase of development and will continue to evolve as Qiskitâ€™s support for dynamic circuit capabilities expressed by OpenQASM 3 increases.

This function is still in the exploratory phase.  Therefore, it is likely that the syntax and capabilities will evolve.

## Import an OpenQASM 3 program into Qiskit

Currently two high-level functions are available for importing from OpenQASM 3 into Qiskit. These functions are `load()`, which takes a file name, and `qasm3.loads()`, which takes the program itself as a string: 


```python
qiskit.qasm3.load(file_name)
```

```python
qiskit.qasm3.loads(program-string)
```

You must install the package `qiskit_qasm3_import ` to use this function.  For example:  

```python
pip install qiskit-qasm3-import
```

In this example, we define a quantum program using OpenQASM 3, and use `qasm3.loads()` to directly convert it into a QuantumCircuit:

```python
import qiskit.qasm3

program = """
    OPENQASM 3.0;
    include "stdgates.inc";

    input float[64] a;
    qubit[3] q;
    bit[2] mid;
    bit[3] out;

    let aliased = q[0:1];

    gate my_gate(a) c, t {
      gphase(a / 2);
      ry(a) c;
      cx c, t;
    }
    gate my_phase(a) c {
      ctrl @ inv @ gphase(a) c;
    }

    my_gate(a * 2) aliased[0], q[{1, 2}][0];
    measure q[0] -> mid[0];
    measure q[1] -> mid[1];

    while (mid == "00") {
      reset q[0];
      reset q[1];
      my_gate(a) q[0], q[1];
      my_phase(a - pi/2) q[1];
      mid[0] = measure q[0];
      mid[1] = measure q[1];
    }

    if (mid[0]) {
      let inner_alias = q[{0, 1}];
      reset inner_alias;
    }

    out = measure q;
"""
circuit = qiskit.qasm3.loads(program)
circuit.draw("mpl")
```

## Export to OpenQASM 3

You can export Qiskit code to OpenQASM 3. See more information in the [Exporting to OpenQASM 3](/api/qiskit/qasm3#exporting-to-openqasm-3) section of the API reference.
