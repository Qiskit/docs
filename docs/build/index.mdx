# Introduction

In the build phase, you create quantum programs that represent the problem you are solving. The foundation of quantum programs are quantum circuits, which are made up of operations -- including gates, measurement, and reset of qubits -- that manipulate qubits in the quantum computer.  Depending on your needs, you can use Qiskit or OpenQASM to create your circuits. 

All tasks require building one or more quantum circuits. Some tasks additionally require constructing quantum operators to define properties of quantum states that we want to estimate/measure.

Qiskit enables working with circuits (and, to a lesser extent, operators) at various abstraction levels: abstract,virtual, physical, scheduled, and pulse program.

At the most abstract level, we have a task-oriented lens in the circuit library. We can also express operations in abstract mathematical terms using Operators, isometries, and classical/Boolean functions. Then we have virtual circuits where those mathematical abstractions take on a concrete representation in terms of a concrete gate set. At the physical level those instructions are mapped to specific physical qubits and instructions are re-written to reflect the connectivity and native gate set of a target hardware platform. Scheduled circuits introduce timing information. Finally, pulse programs represent signals on channels.

Qiskit and OpenQASM further support the notion of extended circuits, which expand the set of allowed operations to include real-time computations on classical values. Qiskit's tooling for working with this richer family of circuits is found in the section on Dynamic circuits.
