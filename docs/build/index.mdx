# Introduction

In the build phase, you create quantum programs that represent the problem you are solving. The foundation of quantum programs are quantum circuits, which are made up of gates (or operations) that are used to manipulate qubits in the quantum computer.  Depending on your needs, you can use Qiskit or OpenQASM to create your circuits.
