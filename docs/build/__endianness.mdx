# Order of qubits in Qiskit

While most physics textbooks represent an $n$-qubit system as the tensor product $Q_0\otimes Q_1 \otimes ... \otimes Q_{n-1}$, where $Q_j$ is the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ qubit, Qiskit uses the inverse order, that is, $Q_{n-1}\otimes ... \otimes Q_1 \otimes Q_{0}$. As explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiqHj3_Avps) from [Qiskit's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@qiskit), this is done to follow the convention in classical computing, in which the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ bit or most significant bit (MSB) is placed on the left (with index 0) while the least significant bit (LSB) is placed on the right (index $n-1$). This ordering convention is called little-endian while the one from the physics textbooks is called big-endian.

This means that if we have, for example, a 3-qubit system with qubit 0 in state $|1\rangle$ and qubits 1 and 2 in state $|0\rangle$, Qiskit would represent this state as $|001\rangle$ while most physics textbooks would represent this state as $|100\rangle$.

The matrix representation of any multi-qubit gate is also affected by this different qubit ordering. For example, if we consider the single-qubit gate

$$
U = \begin{pmatrix} u_{00} & u_{01} \\ u_{10} & u_{11} \end{pmatrix}
$$

And we want a controlled version $C_U$ whose control qubit is qubit 0 and whose target is qubit 1, following Qiskit's ordering its matrix representation would be

$$
C_U = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & u_{00} & 0 & u_{01} \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & u_{10} & 0& u_{11} \end{pmatrix}
$$

while in a physics textbook it would be written as

$$
C_U = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & u_{00} & u_{01} \\ 0 & 0 & u_{00} & u_{01} \end{pmatrix}
$$

For more details about how this ordering of MSB and LSB affects the matrix representation of any particular gate, check its entry in the [circuit library](../api/qiskit/circuit_library).

This different order can also make the circuit corresponding to an algorithm from a textbook a bit more complicated to visualize. Fortunately, Qiskit provides a way to represent a [`QuantumCircuit`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) with the most significant qubits on top, just like in the textbooks. This can be done by setting the `reverse_bits` argument of the [`QuantumCircuit.draw`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#draw) method to `True`.

Let's try this for a 3-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform ([`QFT`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.QFT)).

```python
from qiskit.circuit.library import QFT

qft = QFT(3)
qft.decompose().draw('mpl')
```

```
