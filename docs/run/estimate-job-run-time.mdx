# Estimate job run time

After submitting a job to the IBM Quantum channel, you can see an estimation for how much _quantum time_ the job will take to run by using `job.usage_estimation`.  Alternatively, you can [view this information on the IBM Quantum Platform user interface](#view-usage).

Quantum time is the duration, in seconds, a quantum system is committed to fulfilling a user request.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
    - This only applies to jobs that use primitives.
    - This is not yet available on the IBM Qiskit Runtime on Cloud channel.

<Admonition type="note" title="Important:">
To ensure faster and more efficient results, as of 15 Feb 2024, Qiskit Runtime primitives will no longer transpile circuits.  Instead, you must submit locally-transpiled (*instruction set architecture (ISA)*) circuits.  See the [transpilation documentation](../transpile) for instructions.  Due to this change, transpilation options (`options.transpilation.xxx`) are no longer supported and will be ignored. Additionally, `optimization_level`  no longer performs routing or layout operations.
</Admonition>

Example:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager

service = QiskitRuntimeService()

# Create a new circuit with two qubits (first argument) and two classical
# bits (second argument)
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Add a Hadamard gate to qubit 0
qc.h(0)

# Perform a controlled-X gate on qubit 1, controlled by qubit 0
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure qubit 0 to cbit 0, and qubit 1 to cbit 1
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)

# Run on the least-busy system you have access to
backend = service.least_busy(simulator=False,operational=True)

# Generate ISA circuits
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend)
isa_circuits = pm.run(qc)

# Create a Sampler object
sampler = Sampler(backend)

# Submit the circuit to the sampler
job = sampler.run(isa_qc)

print(job.usage_estimation)
```

Output:

```python
{'quantum_seconds': 4.1058720028432445}
```

## View the estimated job usage on IBM Quantum Platform

You can view the estimated usage (how much quantum time the job will take to run) in two places on IBM Quantum Platform:

- On the [Jobs table](https://quantum.ibm.com/jobs) in the Usage column.  From the Home page, click *View all* on the Recent jobs table.  The Usage column shows the estimated usage for pending jobs, or actual usage for completed jobs. 
- On the job's details page. From the [Dashboard](https://quantum.ibm.com/) or [Jobs table](https://quantum.ibm.com/jobs), click the job ID to open the job details page.  The estimated usage is shown in the Status Timeline.
