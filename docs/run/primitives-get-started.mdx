description: Use Qiskit Runtime Estimator and Sampler

# Get started with primitives

The steps in this topic describes how to set up  primitives, explore the options you can use to configure them, then invoke them in a program.

<Admonition type="note">
    These examples all use the primitives from Qiskit Runtime, but you could use the base primitives instead.

## Get started with Estimator

### 1. Initialize the account

Since Qiskit Runtime `Estimator` is a managed service, you first need to initialize your account. You can then select the simulator or real system you want to use to calculate the expectation value.

Follow the steps in the [Install and set up topic](../start/install) if you don't already have an account.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibm_brisbane")
```

### 2. Create a circuit and an observable

You need at least one circuit and one observable as inputs to the `Estimator` primitive.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="EstimatorV2" label="EstimatorV2">
    For EstimatorV2, the circuit, observable, and optional paramater value sets are input as _primitive unified bloc_ (PUB) tuples. 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="EstimatorV1" label="Estimator (V1)">
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from qiskit.circuit.library import IQP
    from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp, random_hermitian

    n_qubits = 127

    mat = np.real(random_hermitian(n_qubits, seed=1234))
    circuit = IQP(mat)
    observable = SparsePauliOp("Z" * n_qubits)
    print(f">>> Observable: {observable.paulis}")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Initialize Qiskit Runtime Estimator

We want to use Qiskit Runtime's implementation of the `Estimator`, so we initialize an instance of `qiskit_ibm_runtime.Estimator` instead of `qiskit.primitives.Estimator`. 

When you initialize the `Estimator`, you must pass in the system or simulator you previously selected as the target device (or simulator).  You could also do this within the `session` parameter. 


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="EstimatorV2" label="EstimatorV2">
    When using EstimatorV2, for backward compatibility, you must explicitly import EstimatorV2. After V1 support ends, you can use either `import` command (`from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator` or `from qiskit_ibm_runtime import EstimatorV2`) to import EstimatorV2. 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="EstimatorV1" label="Estimator (V1)">
    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator

    estimator = Estimator(backend=backend)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### 4. Invoke the Estimator and get results

You can then invoke the `run()` method to calculate expectation values for the input circuits and observables.

```python
job = estimator.run(circuit, observable)
print(f">>> Job ID: {job.job_id()}")
print(f">>> Job Status: {job.status()}")
```

```python
result = job.result()
print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Expectation value: {result.values[0]}")
print(f"  > Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```

<span id="start-sampler"></span>
## Get started with Sampler

### 1. Initialize the account

Since Qiskit Runtime `Sampler` is a managed service, you will first need to initialize your account. You can then select the simulator or real system you want to use to calculate the expectation value.

Follow the steps in the [Install and set up topic](../start/install) if you don't already have an account set up.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibm_brisbane")
```

### 2. Create a circuit

Just like the section before, you will need at least one circuit as the input to the `Sampler` primitive.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit.circuit.library import IQP
from qiskit.quantum_info import random_hermitian

n_qubits = 127

mat = np.real(random_hermitian(n_qubits, seed=1234))
circuit = IQP(mat)
circuit.measure_all()
```

### 3. Initialize the Qiskit Runtime Sampler

Here we are initializing an instance of `qiskit_ibm_runtime.Sampler` instead of `qiskit.primitives.Sampler` to use Qiskit Runtime's implementation of the `Sampler`. 

When you initialize the `Sampler`, you'll need to pass in the simulator or system you previously selected as the target device (or simulator).  You could also do this within the `session` parameter. 

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Sampler

sampler = Sampler(backend=backend)
```

### 4. Invoke the Sampler and get results

You can then invoke the `run()` method to generate a quasi-probability distribution for the input circuits and quantum states.

```python
job = sampler.run(circuit)
print(f">>> Job ID: {job.job_id()}")
print(f">>> Job Status: {job.status()}")
```
```python
result = job.result()
print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Quasi-probability distribution: {result.quasi_dists[0]}")
print(f"  > Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```
