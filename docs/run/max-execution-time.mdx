title: Maximum execution time for a Qiskit Runtime job or session
description: Describes how long a Qiskit Runtime job or session can run.

---

# Maximum execution time 

To ensure fairness and help control costs, there is a maximum amount of time each Qiskit Runtime job and session can run. If a job exceeds this time limit, it is forcibly canceled and a `RuntimeJobMaxTimeoutError` exception is raised. If a session exceeds its limits, any queued jobs are cancelled but any jobs that are already running are not.

## Job maximum execution time

The maximum execution time for a job is the smaller of these values:

- The value set for max_execution_time
- The system-determined job timeout value

<Admonition type="note">
  As of August 7, 2023, the `max_execution_time` value is based on _quantum time_ instead of wall clock time. Quantum time is the time that the QPU complex (including control software, control electronics, QPU, and so on) is engaged in processing the job. 
  
  Simulator jobs continue to use wall clock time because they do not have quantum time.
</Admonition>

Set the maximum execution time (in seconds) on the job options by using one of the following methods:

```python
# Initiate the Options class with parameters
options = Options(max_execution_time=360)
```

```python
# Create the options object with attributes and values
options = {"max_execution_time": 360}
```

You can also find how much quantum time completed jobs have used by returning the job metrics as follows:

```python
# Find quantum time used by the job
print(f"Quantum time used by job {job.job_id()} was {job.metrics()['usage']['quantum_seconds']} seconds")
```

### System maximum execution time

The system calculates an appropriate job timeout value based on the input circuits and options. This system-calculated timeout is capped at 3 hours to ensure fair device usage. If a `max_execution_time` is also specified for the job, the lesser of the two values is used.

For example, if you specify `max_execution_time=5000` (approximately 83 minutes), but the system determines it should not take more than 5 minutes (300 seconds) to execute the job, then the job is cancelled after 5 minutes.

## Session maximum execution time

When a session is started, it is assigned a maximum session timeout value. After this timeout is reached, the session is terminated, any jobs that are already running continue running, and any queued jobs that remain in the session are put into a failed state. You can set the maximum session timeout value using the `max_time` parameter:

```python
# Set the session max time
with Session(max_time="1h"):
    ...
```    

Additionally, there is a 1-minute *interactive* timeout value. If there are no session jobs queued within that window, the session is temporarily deactivated and normal job selection resumes. During job selection, if the job scheduler gets a new job from the session and its maximum timeout value has not been reached, the session is reactivated until its maximum timeout value is reached.

<Admonition type="note">
  The timer for the sessionâ€™s `max_time` timer is not paused during any temporary deactivation periods.

### Defaults

If you don't specify a session `max_time`, the system defaults are used:


| User account type | Primitive programs | Private programs |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Premium           | 8h                 | 8h               |
| Open              | 15 min             | N/A              |

<Admonition type="note">
  A *premium user* here means a user who has access to backends in providers other than ibm-q/open/main.

## Other limitations

*   Programs cannot exceed 750KB in size.
*   Inputs to jobs cannot exceed 64MB in size.
