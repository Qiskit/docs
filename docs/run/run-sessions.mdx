# Run jobs in a session

There are several ways to set up and use [sessions](sessions). The following
information should not be considered mandatory steps to follow. Instead,
choose the configuration that best suits your needs. This
information assumes that you are using Qiskit Runtime
[primitives](./primitives-get-started).

## Prerequisites

Before starting a session, you must [set up Qiskit Runtime](../start/install) and initialize it as a service:

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
```

## Open a session

You can open a runtime session by using the context manager `with Session(...)` or by initializing the `Session`
class. When you start a session, you can specify options, such as the
backend to run on. This topic describes the most commonly used options.
For the full list, see the [Sessions API documentation](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session#session).

<Admonition type="note" title="Important">
    Data from the first session job is cached and used by subsequent jobs. Therefore, if the first job is canceled, subsequent session jobs will all fail.
</Admonition>


**Session class**

A session can be created by initializing the `Session` class, which can then be passed to the desired primitives. Example:

``` python
session = Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator")
estimator = Estimator(session=session)
sampler = Sampler(session=session)
```

**Context manager**

The context manager automatically opens a session for you. A session is
started when the first primitive job in this context manager starts (not when it is queued). Primitives created in the context automatically use
that session. Example:

``` python
with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator"):
  estimator = Estimator()
  sampler = Sampler()
```

## Specify a backend

When you start a session, you can specify session options, such as the
backend to run on. A backend is required if you are using the IBM
Quantum channel, but optional if you are using the IBM Cloud channel.
Once specified, you cannot change the backend used for a session and you
cannot specify multiple backends within a session. To use a different
backend, open a new session.

There are two ways to specify a backend in a session:

**Directly specify a string with the backend name.** Example:

``` python
backend = "ibmq_qasm_simulator"
with Session(backend=backend):
    ...
```

**Pass the backend object.** Example:

``` python
backend = service.get_backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
with Session(backend=backend):
  ...
```

## Specify the session length

When a session is started, it is assigned a maximum session timeout
value. After the session has been open the specified amount of time, the
session expires and is forcefully closed. You can no longer submit jobs
to that session. See [What happens when a session ends?](sessions#ends) for further details.

You can configure the maximum session timeout value through the
`max_time` parameter, which can be specified as seconds
(int) or a string, like "2h 30m 40s". This value has to be greater
than the `max_execution_time` of the job and less than the
system's `max_time`. The default value is the system's
`max_time`. See [What is the maximum execution time for a Qiskit Runtime job?](max-execution-time) to determine the
system limit.

When setting the session length, consider how long each job within the
session might take. For example, if you run five jobs within a session
and each job is estimated to be five minutes long, the maximum time for
the session should at least 25 min.

``` python
with Session(service=service, backend=backend, max_time="25m"):
  ...   
```

There is also an interactive timeout value (ITTL, or interactive time to live) that cannot be configured. For premium accounts, the ITTL is 1 min, and for open plan accounts, the ITTL is 2 sec. If no session jobs are queued within that window, the session is temporarily deactivated. For more details about session length and timeout, see [How long a session stays active](sessions#active).

## Close a session 

### For Qiskit Runtime 13.0 or later releases

When the session context manager is exited, the session is put into `Not accepting new jobs` status.  This means that the session will finish processing all running or queued jobs until the maximum timeout value is reached.  After all jobs are completed, the session is immediately closed. This allows the
scheduler to run the next job without waiting for the session interactive timeout,
therefore reducing the average job queueing time. You cannot submit jobs to a
closed session.

``` python
with Session(service=service, backend=backend) as session:
    estimator = Estimator()
    job = estimator.run(...)
    
# The session is no longer accepting jobs but the submitted job will run to completion    
result = job.result()
```

### For Qiskit runtime releases before 13.0

When jobs are all done, it is recommended that you use
`session.close()` to close the session. This allows the
scheduler to run the next job without waiting for the session timeout,
therefore making it easier for everyone. You cannot submit jobs to a
closed session.

<Admonition type="note" title="Important">
    Close a session only after all session jobs **complete**, rather than immediately after they have all been submitted. Session jobs that are not completed will fail.
</Admonition>


``` python
with Session(service=service, backend=backend) as session:
    estimator = Estimator()
    job = estimator.run(...)
    # Do not close here, the job might not be completed!
    result = job.result()
    # Reaching this line means that the job is finished.
    session.close()
```

## Invoke multiple primitives in a session

You are not restricted to a single primitive function within a session. In this section we will show you an example of using multiple primitives. 

First we prepare a circuit for the Sampler primitive.

```python
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit

sampler_circuit = random_circuit(2, 2, seed=0).decompose(reps=1)
sampler_circuit.measure_all()
display(circuit.draw("mpl"))
```

The example below shows how you can create both an instance of the `Sampler` class and one of the `Estimator` class and invoke their `run()` methods within a session. 

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session, Sampler, Estimator

with Session(backend=backend):
    sampler = Sampler()
    estimator = Estimator()

    result = sampler.run(sampler_circuit).result()
    print(f">>> Quasi-probability distribution from the sampler job: {result.quasi_dists[0]}")

    result = estimator.run(circuit, observable).result()
    print(f">>> Expectation value from the estimator job: {result.values[0]}")
    ```
The calls can also be synchronous. You donâ€™t need to wait for the result of a previous job before submitting another one, as shown below:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session, Sampler, Estimator

with Session(backend=backend):
    sampler = Sampler()
    estimator = Estimator()

    sampler_job = sampler.run(sampler_circuit)
    estimator_job = estimator.run(circuit, observable)

    print(
        f">>> Quasi-probability distribution from the sampler job: {sampler_job.result().quasi_dists[0]}"
    )
    print(f">>> Expectation value from the estimator job: {estimator_job.result().values[0]}")
```

## Query session status

You can query the status of a session using `session.status()`.  You can also view a session's status on the Jobs page for your channel.

Session status can be one of the following:

- `Pending`: Session has not started or has been deactivated. 
- `In progress, accepting new jobs`: Session is active and accepting new jobs.
- `In progress, not accepting new jobs`: Session is active but not accepting new jobs. Job submission to the session will be rejected, but outstanding session jobs will run to completion. The session will be automatically closed once all jobs finish. 
- `Closed`: Session maximum timeout value has been reached, or session was explicitly closed.

<span id="session-details"></span>
## Determine session details

You can find details about a session by using the `session.details()` method, from the [Quantum Platform Jobs page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jobs), or from the IBM Cloud Jobs page, which you access from your [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances). From the session details you can determine the [maximum](#max-ttl) and [interactive](#ttl) time to live (TTL) values, its status, whether it's currently accepting jobs, and more. 

Example:

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()

with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator") as session:
  session.details()
  ...
  print(f"The maximum session time is {session_details["max_time"]}.")
  print(f"The interactive TTL is {session_details["interactive_ttl"]}.")
```

## Full example

In this example, we start a session, run an Estimator job, and output
the result:

``` python
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, Estimator, Options

circuit = random_circuit(2, 2, seed=1).decompose(reps=1)
observable = SparsePauliOp("IY")

options = Options()
options.optimization_level = 2
options.resilience_level = 2

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator") as session:
    estimator = Estimator(options=options)
    job = estimator.run(circuit, observable)
    result = job.result()
    # Close the session only if all jobs are finished, and you don't need to run more in the session
    session.close()

display(circuit.draw("mpl"))
print(f" > Observable: {observable.paulis}")
print(f" > Expectation value: {result.values[0]}")
print(f" > Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```
