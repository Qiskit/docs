# Run primitives in a batch

Batch mode is ideal for running experiments closely together to avoid device drifts,
that is, to maintain device characterization.

-   Suitable for batching many jobs together.
-   The classical computation, such as compilation, of the jobs is run in parallel. This means running multiple jobs in a batch would be significantly faster than running them serially. 

<Admonition type="note">
    When batching, jobs are not guaranteed to run in the order they are submitted.

The following example shows how you can divide up a long list of circuits into multiple jobs and run them as a batch to take advantage of the parallel processing.

```python
backend = service.backend("ibm_sherbrooke")

with Session(backend=backend):
    estimator = Estimator()
    start_idx = 0
    jobs = []
    while start_idx < len(circuits):
        end_idx = start_idx + backend.max_circuits
        jobs.append(estimator.run(circuits[start_idx:end_idx], obs[start_idx:end_idx], params[start_idx:end_idx]))
        start_idx = end_idx
```
