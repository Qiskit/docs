# Run primitives in a batch

Batch mode is ideal for running experiments closely together to avoid device drifts, that is, to maintain device characterization.  All jobs must be provided at the outset. If you want to submit iterative jobs, use [sessions](sessions) instead.

-   Suitable for batching many jobs together.
-   The classical computation, such as compilation, of the jobs is run in parallel. This means running multiple jobs in a batch would be significantly faster than running them serially. 

<Admonition type="note">
    When batching, jobs are not guaranteed to run in the order they are submitted.

The following example shows how you can divide up a long list of circuits into multiple jobs and run them as a batch to take advantage of the parallel processing.

```python
jobs = []
with Batch(backend) as batch:
    estimator = Estimator(batch)
    # calls within this context are part of the batch.
    for obs_set in observable_sets:
        jobs.append(estimator.run(circuits, observables=obs_set))
```
