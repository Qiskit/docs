# Manage your account

Qiskit Runtime is available on both IBM Quantum Platform and IBM Cloud. The former requires an IBM Quantum account and the latter requires an IBM Cloud account. If you donâ€™t have an account, get one at the appropriate link:

*   [IBM Quantum account](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/account)
*   [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started)


The user account performs two essential functions. First, an account is associated with one or more [instances](instances) that give access to  IBM Quantum services. Second, a unique token is assigned to each account, allowing for IBM Quantum access from Qiskit.

## View your account

Follow the instructions in the appropriate section to access your account. 

### View an IBM Quantum Platform account 

You can view your IBM Quantum account information after you log in to [IBM Quantum](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) by clicking Manage account in the account menu ( ![account](/images/migration/account-231.png) ). From this page you can view and edit general account information, copy or regenerate your API token, change your notification settings, and find your instances. You will also come here if you ever need to delete your account.

<Admonition type="info" title="Notes">
  * Your unique API token provides access to your data, so treat it as you would any password and keep it secure.
  * Account deletion is permanent, and cannot be undone. All data are permanently removed.
  * IBM Quantum is required to send you email notifications about your account and privacy.
</Admonition>

### View an IBM Quantum on IBM Cloud account

You can view your IBM Quantum account information after you log in to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/) by clicking Profile in the account menu ( ![account](/images/migration/account-231.png) ). The Account settings page lets you view and edit your contact information, view your active sessions, and change your notification preferences.  

## Account management methods

There are several methods for account management. Your account credentials can be saved to disk or used in a session and never saved.

*   save_account(): Save your account to disk for future use.
*   delete_account(): Delete the saved account from disk.
*   active_account(): List the account currently in the session.
*   saved_account(): List the account stored on disk.

## Store credentials

The `save_account()` method can be used to store your account credentials on disk, in the `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` file. After the credentials are saved, you will only need to use `QiskitRuntimeService()` to initialize your account in the future.

<Admonition type="note">
  Account credentials are saved in plain text, so only do so if you are using a trusted device.
</Admonition>

Following are examples of saving an IBM Quantum  and an IBM Cloud account. The `channel` parameter allows you to distinguish between different account types. If you are saving multiple accounts per channel, consider using the `name` parameter to differentiate them.  

<Admonition type="note">
IBM Cloud is the default account used if you don't specify a different channel or account name. 
</Admonition>

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# Save an IBM Quantum account on disk.
QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<IBM Quantum API token>", set_as_default=True)

# Save an IBM Cloud account on disk.
QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_cloud", token="<IBM Cloud API key>", instance="<IBM Cloud CRN>" or "<IBM Cloud service name>")

```

## Initialize your account

You need to initialize your account in a Python session before you can start using Qiskit Runtime. If you have the credentials saved, you can initialize an `QiskitRuntimeService` instance without additional parameters.

```python
# Read default credentials from disk.
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
```

If you want to use your credentials for just the session rather than saving them, you can pass the credentials in when initializing the `QiskitRuntimeService` instance:

```python
# Initialize an IBM Cloud account without saving it.
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_cloud", token=<IBM Cloud API key>, instance=<IBM Cloud CRN>)
```
