# Monitor a job

Jobs are listed on the Jobs page for your quantum service channel:

*   IBM Cloud&reg; channel: From the IBM Cloud console quantum [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances), click the name of your instance, then click the Jobs tab.
*   IBM Quantum&trade; channel: In IBM Quantum Platform, open the [Jobs page](https://quantum.ibm.com/jobs).

Use the job instance to check the job status or retrieve the results by calling the appropriate command:

|                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| job.result()                  | Review job results immediately after the job completes. Job results are available after the job completes. Therefore, job.result() is a blocking call until the job completes.                               |
| job.job\_id()                 | Return the ID that uniquely identifies that job. Retrieving the job results at a later time requires the job ID. Therefore, it is recommended that you save the IDs of jobs you might want to retrieve later. |
| job.status()                  | Check the job status.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| job = service.job(\<job\_id>) | Retrieve a job you previously submitted. This call requires the job ID.                                                                                                                                      |

<span id="retrieve-later"></span>
## Retrieve job results at a later time

Call `service.job(\<job\_id>)` to retrieve a job you previously submitted. If you donâ€™t have the job ID, or if you want to retrieve multiple jobs at once; including jobs from retired systems, call `service.jobs()` with optional filters instead. See [QiskitRuntimeService.jobs](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#jobs).

<Admonition type="note">
  service.jobs() returns only Qiskit Runtime jobs. To retrieve other jobs, use [qiskit-ibm-provider](../api/qiskit-ibm-provider/qiskit_ibm_provider.IBMBackend#ibmbackend) instead.

## Example

This example returns the 10 most recent runtime jobs that were run on `my_backend`:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# Initialize the account first.
service = QiskitRuntimeService()

service.jobs(backend_name=my_backend)
```


## Fixed and dynamic repetition rate execution

### Fixed repetition rate execution

Most IBM Quantum&trade; systems execute circuits at a fixed rate. Although this *repetition rate* varies by system, the underlying execution model is the same, and is described here. First, consider three circuits sent to a system using separate jobs, one for each circuit. The example below shows what happens for jobs of varying lengths. Because of the fixed repetition rate, there is a variable amount of *idle time* that occurs before the start of a circuit in order to make the entire duration match that given by the system repetition rate.

![With fixed-rate execution, shorter jobs result in longer idle time.](/images/run/fixed_single_circuit1.png "Idle time versus job length")

The situation changes somewhat when the same circuits are batched into a single job. In this case the circuits included in the job are executed by iterating over the circuits for each shot requested; the execution is column-wise over a matrix of circuits and shots (see below).

![The first column represents shot 0.  The circuits are run in order from 0 through 3.  The second column represents shot 1.  The circuits are run in order from 0 through 3.  The remaining columns follow the same pattern. ](/images/run/circuits_shots_matrix1.png "Column-wise execution matrix")

When submitting batches of circuits to the systems, the circuits are executed differently than they would be if executed separately. Namely, the initialization of the circuit, that is, prepare the ground state, and measurements (if any) are aligned over all circuits.

![The image shows three circuits.  Although they are different lengths, they take the same amount of time to complete because they were submitted in a batch.](/images/run/fixed_batch_circuit1.png)

Therefore, each circuit is equal in duration to the longest circuit in the batch, and there is a common idle time that is placed in front of all circuits to match the repetition rate.

### Dynamic repetition rate execution

Some IBM Quantum systems allow for dynamic repetition rate execution. These systems are identified in Qiskit using `backend.configuration().dynamic_reprate_enabled`, and return a value of `True`. On these systems, it is possible to manually set the above idle time by setting the `rep_delay` of the submitted job. One can see from the above figures that by reducing the idle time one can potentially see a greater throughput of circuits on the systems that support dynamic repetition rates.
