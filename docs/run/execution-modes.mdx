# Introduction to Qiskit Runtime execution modes

There are several ways to run jobs, depending on your needs.

**Job mode**: A single primitive request of the estimator or the sampler made without a context manager. Circuits and inputs are packaged as primitive unified blocs (PUBs) and submitted as an execution task on the quantum computer.

[**Sessions mode**](sessions): A dedicated window for running multi-job workload. This allows users to experiment with variational algorithms in a more predictable way and even run multiple experiments simultaneously taking advantage of parallelism in the stack. Use sessions for iterative workloads. See [Run jobs in a session](run-jobs-in-session) for examples. 

[**Batch mode**](run-jobs-in-batch): A multi-job manager for efficiently running an experiment that is comprised of bundle of independent jobs. Use batch mode to submit multiple primitive jobs simultaneously.

## Best practices

To ensure the most efficient use of the execution modes, the following practices are recommended:  

- Always close your session, either by using a context manager or by specifying `session.close()`.
- There is a fixed overhead associated with running a job. In general, if your each of your job uses less than one minute of QPU time, consider combining several into one larger job (this applies to all execution modes). "QPU time" refers to time spent by the QPU complex to process your job. 
    
    A job's QPU time is listed in the **Usage** column on the IQP [Jobs](https://quantum.ibm.com/jobs) page, or you can  query it by using  `qiskit-ibm-runtime` with this command `job.metrics()["usage"]["quantum_seconds"]`

- If each of your jobs consume more than one minute of QPU time, or if combining jobs is not practical, you can still run multiple jobs in parallel. Every job goes through both classical and quantum processing. While a QPU can process only one job at a time, up to five classical jobs can be processed in parallel. You can take advantage of this by submitting multiple jobs in [batch](run-jobs-in-batch#divide) or [session](run-jobs-in-session#two-vqe) execution mode. 

The above are general guidelines, and you should tune your workload to find the optimal ratio, especially when using sessions. For example, running smaller jobs in parallel might be more cost effective because of reduced wall clock time.

## Sessions versus batch 

[This image shows multiple sets of jobs.  Within each set, and between each job, is the interactive TTL (time to live).  The active window starts when the first job starts and ends after the last job is completed. After the final job of the first set of jobs completes, the active window ends and the session is paused.  Another set of jobs then starts and jobs continue in a similar manner.](/images/run/SessionVsBatch.png 'Sessions compared to batch')

## Billing

* Single jobs are billed for the quantum time they use in processing. 
* Sessions are billed for the entire active session time. 
* For batched jobs, you are billed for the time the QPU complex is processing your job.
