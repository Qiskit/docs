# Run jobs in batch mode with REST API

Alternatively, you can also submit a batch job by specifying the `session_mode` in the request payload.

```python
import json
 
sessionsUrl = "https://api.quantum-computing.ibm.com/runtime/sessions"
 
headersList = {
  "Accept": "application/json",
  # "Authorization": "Bearer "+token,
  'x-access-token':auth_id,
  "Content-Type": "application/json" 
}
 
payload = json.dumps({
  "backend": backend,
  "instance": "ibm-q/open/main",
  "session_mode": "batch"
})
 
response = requests.request("POST", sessionsUrl, data=payload,  headers=headersList)
 
sessionId = response.json()['id']
```
