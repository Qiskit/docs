# Introduction

In the run phase, you send your quantum program to be executed on a quantum system. This section provides information about IBM Quantum hardware and how to connect to the instances that provide access to quantum systems. You can find details about estimating job run time and cost, running within a session, reserving time on a system, and more. 

The steps during the run phase are:

1. Using your [account](./account-management) credentials, authenticate to the channel of your choice ([IBM Quantum Platform](../start/install#ibm-quantum-platform) or [IBM Cloud](../start/install#ibm-cloud)).
2. Choose a backend.
3. Send a job to a quantum system.
4. View job results.
