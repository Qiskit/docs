title: Native gates and operations
description: Summary of the native gates and operations supported by IBM Quantum systems

# Native gates and operations

Each [processor family](processor-types) has a native gate set, and the systems in each family support running only those particular gates and operations. Transpilation translates an arbitrary circuit to the native gate set supported by a specified system.  You can view the native gates and operations for a system either [with Qiskit](#native-gates-with-qiskit) or on the IBM Quantum Platform [Compute resources page](#native-gates-on-platform).

## Find the native gate set for a system

<span id="native-gates-with-qiskit"></span>
### With Qiskit

```python

from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum")

for backend in service.backends():
    config = backend.configuration()
    if "simulator" in config.backend_name:
        continue
    print(f"Backend: {config.backend_name}")
    print(f"    Processor type: {config.processor_type}")
    print(f"    Supported instructions:")
    for instruction in config.supported_instructions:
        print(f"        {instruction}")
    print()
```

### On IBM Quantum Platform

Select any system on the [Compute resources](https://quantum.ibm.com/services/resources) tab. The default gates for that system are listed under Details. Note that the non-unitary operations are not listed here; use the method in Qiskit described above to see all native gates and operations for a system.

## Table of gates and operations

<Admonition type="tip" title="The init_qubits flag">

By default, the `init_qubits` flag is set to True. If the `init_qubits` flag is set to False, you must insert [resets](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.Reset) at the start of your circuit to start your qubits in the ground state. Otherwise, qubits will begin in their state from the previous shot.
