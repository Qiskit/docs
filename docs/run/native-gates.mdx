description: Summary of the native gates and operations supported by IBM Quantum systems

# Native gates and operations

Each [processor family](processor-types) has a native gate set. By default, the systems in each family only support running the gates and operations in the native gate set. Thus, every gate in the circuit must be translated (by the transpiler) to the elements of this set.

You can view the native gates and operations for a system either [with Qiskit](#native-gates-with-qiskit) or on the IBM Quantum Platform [Compute resources page](#native-gates-on-platform).

<Admonition type="note" title="Basis gates">
The terms native gates and basis gates are often used interchangeably. However, you can specify a different set of basis gates to use, while the native gate set never changes. For information about changing the basis gates, see the [Represent quantum computers](../transpile/representing_quantum_computers#basis-gates) topic in the Transpile section.

### With Qiskit

```python

from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum")

for backend in service.backends():
    config = backend.configuration()
    if "simulator" in config.backend_name:
        continue
    print(f"Backend: {config.backend_name}")
    print(f"    Processor type: {config.processor_type}")
    print(f"    Supported instructions:")
    for instruction in config.supported_instructions:
        print(f"        {instruction}")
    print()
```

### On IBM Quantum Platform

Select any system on the [Compute resources](https://quantum.ibm.com/services/resources) tab. The default gates for that system are listed under Details. Note that the non-unitary operations are not listed here; use the method in Qiskit described above to see all native gates and operations for a system.

<Admonition type="tip" title="The init_qubits flag">

By default, the `init_qubits` flag is set to True. If the `init_qubits` flag is set to False, you must insert [resets](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.Reset) at the start of your circuit to start your qubits in the ground state. Otherwise, if your job consists of multiple circuits, the qubits will begin in their state from the previous shot. (If a job consists of multiple circuits, the shots will be executed in a "round-robin" fashion. That is, one shot will be collected from every circuit, and then the next shot will be collected from every circuit, and so on.)
