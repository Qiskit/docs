# Run workloads with quantum serverless

Premium users can run their workloads remotely on classical compute made available through IBM Quantum Platform.

## Build a workflow

Here is an example of computing the quasi-probability distribution of a quantum circuit using the Qiskit Runtime Sampler primitive. This Python script should be saved in your working directory. (Warning! All contents of the working directory will be shipped to the cluster for execution.)

```python
# source_files/my_qiskit_pattern.py

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, Options, Estimator

from quantum_serverless import save_result

# all print statement will be available in job logs
print("Running program 1...")

# creating circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.measure_all()

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
options = Options(optimization_level=1)
options.execution.shots = 1024

# sessions allow grouping a collection of iterative
# calls to the quantum computer
with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator") as session:
    # running Estimator primitive
    estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)
    job = estimator.run(circuit)
    quasi_dists = job.result().quasi_dists

    # save results of program execution,
    # which will be accessible by calling `.result()`
    save_result(quasi_dists)

    # Close the session only if all jobs are finished
    # and you don't need to run more in the session.
    session.close()

print("Completed running program 1.")
```

## Remotely execute workflow on quantum serverless

After creating a workflow, authenticate to the `IBMServerlessProvider` with your [IBM Quantum token](account-management). Finally, the workflow is ready to run remotely.

```python
# Authenticate to the IBM serverless provider
from quantum_serverless import IBMServerlessProvider
serverless = IBMServerlessProvider("YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN")

# Deploy the workflow
from quantum_serverless import QiskitPattern
serverless.upload(
    QiskitPattern(
        title="My-Qiskit-Pattern",
        entrypoint="my_qiskit_pattern.py",
        working_dir="./source_files/"
    )
)

# Run workflow remotely
job = serverless.run("My-Qiskit-Pattern")

# Retrieve workflow status, logs, results
job.status()
job.logs()
job.result()
```

## Migration guide

Qiskit Runtime custom programs can be easily migrated to quantum serverless via this [migration guide](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/migration/migration_from_qiskit_runtime_programs.html).
