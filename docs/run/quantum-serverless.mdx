# Run Qiskit Patterns with Quantum Serverless

Premium users can run their workloads remotely on classical compute made available through IBM Quantum Platform.

For more information, see the [Quantum Serverless docs](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/).

## Qiskit Patterns

Creating utility-scale quantum applications generally requires a variety of compute resource requirements. Quantum Serverless can be used to easily submit quantum workflows for remote, managed execution. These quantum workflows can typically be implemented within a common pattern, which we call a Qiskit Pattern. A Qiskit Pattern is an intuitive, repeatable set of steps for implementing a quantum computing workflow.

Steps in a Qiskit Pattern:

1. Map classical inputs to a quantum problem
2. Optimize problem for quantum execution
3. Execute using Qiskit Runtime primitives
4. Post-process, return result in classical format

Once we have built a Qiskit Pattern, we can use Quantum Serverless to deploy it and submit it for managed execution. Overall, the process of creating quantum software and submitting it for managed execution on a remote cluster can be broken down into 3 steps:

5. Build the Qiskit Pattern
6. Deploy to the cloud
7. Run the Qiskit Pattern on the cloud

Premium users can run their workloads remotely on classical compute made available through IBM Quantum Platform.

For more information, see the [Quantum Serverless docs](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/).

## Building a Qiskit Pattern

Here is an example of computing the expectation value using the Qiskit Runtime Estimator primitive. This Python script should be saved in your working directory. (Warning! All contents of the working directory will be shipped to the cluster for execution.)

```python
# source_files/my_qiskit_pattern.py

from qiskit import transpile
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Estimator
from quantum_serverless import save_result

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.least_busy(simulator=False)

# Step 1: Map the classical input to an abstract circuit and observables
abstract_circuit = random_circuit(2, 2, seed=1234)
observable = SparsePauliOp("IY")

# Step 2: Optimize the circuit for quantum execution
target_circuit = transpile(abstract_circuit, backend)
target_observable = observable.apply_layout(target_circuit.layout)

# Step 3: Execute the target circuit
estimator = Estimator(backend)
job = estimator.run(target_circuit, target_observable)
result = job.result()

# Step 4: Postprocess the results
print(result)

# save results of program execution
# note: saved items must be serializable
save_result(result.values)
```

## Deploying a Qiskit Pattern to Quantum Serverless

After creating a pattern, authenticate to the `IBMServerlessProvider` with your [IBM Quantum token](account-management), which can be obtained from your [IBM Quantum account](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/account), and upload the script.

```python
# Authenticate to the IBM serverless provider
from quantum_serverless import IBMServerlessProvider
serverless = IBMServerlessProvider("YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN")

# Deploy the pattern
from quantum_serverless import QiskitPattern
serverless.upload(
    QiskitPattern(
        title="My-Qiskit-Pattern",
        entrypoint="my_qiskit_pattern.py",
        working_dir="./source_files/"
    )
)
```

## Running a Qiskit Pattern remotely on Quantum Serverless

Finally, the pattern is ready to run remotely.

```python
# Run pattern remotely
job = serverless.run("My-Qiskit-Pattern")

# Retrieve status, logs, results
job.status()
job.logs()
job.result()
```

## Migration guide

Qiskit Runtime custom programs can be easily migrated to Quantum Serverless via this [migration guide](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/migration/migration_from_qiskit_runtime_programs.html).
