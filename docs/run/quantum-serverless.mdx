# Run workloads using quantum serverless

Premium users can run remotely their workloads on classical compute made available through IQP.

## Build a workflow

Here is an example of computing the quasiprobability distribution of a quantum circuit using the Qiskit Runtime Sampler Primitive. This python script should be saved in your working directory (Warning! All contents of the working directory will be shipped to the cluster for execution).

TODO: modify this example to set up the QiskitRuntimeService (no need to pass token again since it’s retrieved automatically for user when they’ve authenticated to the IBMServerlessProvider) using the Sampler Primitive inside a Session.

```python
# source_files/program.py

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.primitives import Sampler

from quantum_serverless import save_result

# all print statement will be available in job logs
print("Running program 1...")

# creating circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2)
circuit.h(0)
circuit.cx(0, 1)
circuit.measure_all()

# running Sampler primitive
sampler = Sampler()
quasi_dists = sampler.run(circuit).result().quasi_dists

# save results of program execution,
# which will be accessible by calling `.result()`
save_result(quasi_dists)
print("Completed running program 1.")
```

## Remotely execute workflow on quantum serverless

After creating a workflow, authenticate to the IBMServerlessProvider with your IBM Quantum token (TODO: link to to where this is explained already). Finally, the workflow is ready to run remotely.

```python
# Authenticate to the IBM serverless provider
from quantum_serverless import IBMServerlessProvider
provider = IBMServerlessProvider("YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN")

# Set up the quantum serverless client
from quantum_serverless import QuantumServerless
serverless = QuantumServerless(provider)

# Specify workflow
from quantum_serverless import Program
program = Program(
    title="My program", entrypoint="program.py", working_dir="./source_files/"
)

# Run workflow remotely
job = serverless.run(program)

# Retrieve workflow status, logs, results
# job.status()
# job.logs()
# job.result()
```

## Migration guide

Qiskit Runtime custom programs can be easily migrated to quantum serverless via this [migration guide](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/migration/migration_from_qiskit_runtime_programs.html).
