# Configure runtime compilation for Qiskit Runtime

Runtime compilation techniques optimize and transform your circuit to minimize errors. Runtime compilation adds some classical pre-processing overhead to your overall runtime. Therefore, it is important to achieve a balance between perfecting your results and ensuring that your job completes in a reasonable amount of time.

Primitives let you employ runtime compilation by setting the optimization level (`optimization_level` option) and by choosing advanced runtime compilation options.

<admonition type="note">V2 primitives support optimization levels 0 and 1 only.</admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Important:">
To ensure faster and more efficient results, as of 1 March 2024, circuits and observables need to be transformed to only use instructions supported by the system (referred to as *instruction set architecture (ISA)* circuits and observables) before being submitted to the Qiskit Runtime primitives.  See the [transpilation documentation](../transpile) for instructions to transform circuits.  Due to this change, the primitives will no longer perform layout or routing operations, consequently transpilation options referring to those tasks will no longer have any effect. Users may still request that the Primitives do no optimization of input circuits via `options.transpilation.skip_transpilation`.

## Set the optimization level

The `optimization_level` setting specifies how much optimization to perform on the circuits. Higher levels generate more optimized circuits, at the expense of longer compile times.

<Admonition>
  In primitive version 1, optimization levels 2 and 3 behave identically to level 1.

        Light optimization:

        -   Single-qubit gate optimization
        -   Two-qubit gate optimization
        -   Error suppression: dynamical decoupling (V1 primitives only.  For V2 primitives, you can enable it by using the `dynamical_decoupling` option.)

<Admonition type="note">
  If using an IBM Cloud Qiskit Runtime service instance with Q-CTRL performance management enabled, there is no need to specify runtime optimization or resilience levels, as the strategy includes an automatic preset.
  
  Q-CTRL defaults to `optimization_level=3` and `resilience_level=1`.
  Setting `optimization_level` or `resilience_level` equal to 0 will result in an
  execution error. Levels 1, 2, and 3 are permitted but will not impact performance.
  Setting other options will likewise not impact performance, and it may result in a
  runtime warning. For more information visit the [Q-CTRL documentation](https://docs.q-ctrl.com/q-ctrl-embedded).

### Example: configure Estimator with optimization levels

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Estimator, Options
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
from qiskit.circuit.library import RealAmplitudes
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
options = Options(optimization_level=1)

psi = RealAmplitudes(num_qubits=2, reps=2)
H = SparsePauliOp.from_list([("II", 1), ("IZ", 2), ("XI", 3)])
theta = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]

pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend)
psi = pm.run(psi)
H = H.apply_layout(psi.layout)

estimator = Estimator (options=options, backend=backend)

job = estimator.run(circuits=[psi], observables=[H], parameter_values=[theta])
psi1_H1 = job.result()
```

<Admonition type="note">
  If the optimization level is not specified, the service uses `optimization_level = 1`.

### Example: configure Sampler with optimization levels

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="SamplerV2" label="SamplerV2">
    ```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Samplerv2 as Sampler, Options

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
options = Options(optimization_level=1)

sampler = Sampler(options=options, backend=backend)
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="SamplerV1" label="Sampler (V1)">
    ```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler, Options

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
options = Options(optimization_level=1)

sampler = Sampler(options=options, backend=backend)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Advanced runtime compilation options

Future versions of the primitives will offer options to tune runtime compilation. Currently, the only option with any effect is `skip_transpilation` (bool), which turns off all optimizations done with the primitives.
