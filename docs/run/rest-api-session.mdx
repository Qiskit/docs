# Run jobs in a session with REST API

You begin with creating a session and obtaining a Session ID. More details about Sessions can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/runtime).

```python
import json
 
sessionsUrl = "https://api.quantum-computing.ibm.com/runtime/sessions"
 
headersList = {
  "Accept": "application/json",
  # "Authorization": "Bearer "+token,
  'x-access-token':auth_id,
  "Content-Type": "application/json" 
}
 
payload = json.dumps({
  "backend": backend,
  "instance": "ibm-q/open/main",
})
 
response = requests.request("POST", sessionsUrl, data=payload,  headers=headersList)
 
sessionId = response.json()['id']
 
print(response.json())
```
Output
```text
{'id': 'crw9s7cdbt40008jxesg'}
```

It is very good practice to close a `Session` when all jobs are done. This will reduce wait time for subsequent users.

```python
closureURL="https://api.quantum-computing.ibm.com/runtime/sessions/"+sessionId+"/close"

headersList = {
  "Accept": "application/json",
  # "Authorization": "Bearer "+token,
  'x-access-token':auth_id,
}
 
closure_response = requests.request(
    "DELETE",
    closureURL, 
    headers=headersList)

print("Session closure response ok?:",closure_response.ok,closure_response.text)
```
Output
```text
Session closure response ok?: True 
```
