# Best practices for your project

If you have an idea for a Qiskit-based project, you'll often want to share it
with the community. Putting your code online is a good start, but if a user
can't work out how to install or use your project, they'll give up and move on.
This page covers licensing, packaging, testing, and documenting your project,
all of which improve your users' experience. If you're releasing research code,
following best practices will also help others reproduce your results.

Once you've put the finishing touches on it, consider adding your project to the [Qiskit
ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem).

## GitHub

Most Qiskit projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), a source-code
hosting platform. GitHub is based on [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a version
control system. It provides a large set of tools to collaborate and
maintain high quality. See [Github
skills](https://skills.github.com/) to get up to speed on GitHub quickly.

Some key features are:

* **Issues and pull requests**

  Users can use GitHub to report bugs in your project or request changes to it.
  Your team and external contributors can use pull requests to propose and
  review changes to your project's code.

  If you want to accept contributions from others, make sure to add a
  [contributing
  guide](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors)
  and a [code of
  conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project).

* **GitHub actions**

  This feature runs scripts in the cloud when certain events happen in your
  GitHub repo. For example, you can run your [test suite](#test-your-project)
  when you push new code or automatically [publish your
  package](#package-your-project) when you tag a commit.

  Use GitHub actions for [continuous
  integration](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration)
  (CI) and [continuous
  deployment](https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-deployment) (CD) of your
  project.

* **Security features**

  GitHub supports features to keep your projects secure. These include:

  * [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates)
    – a tool to automatically update your dependencies.
  * [Trusted publishing to PyPI](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) –
    to reduce the risk of a malicious actor gaining control of your package.
  * [Branch
    protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
    – to make sure code meets some criteria before being pushed to certain
    branches.

The rest of this page will assume you have your project hosted on GitHub, although
you are welcome to other providers like GitLab.

## Choose a license

If you want others to use your project, you *must* choose an appropriate
license. Otherwise, your grant no permission for others to use it. Most
projects in the [Qiskit ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem) use
the Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses. Visit GitHub's
[choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) to decide which license is
best for you, and consider seeking legal help.

Add your license to the top level of your repository in a text file named
`LICENSE`. When you create a new repository, GitHub will give you the option to
automatically add a standard license.

## Dependency management

Most projects depend on other projects, such as Qiskit or NumPy. If you don't
clearly specify your project's dependencies, users (including your future self)
will struggle to install and use it.

The simplest way to list your requirements is to put the Python version you're
using in your `README` and include a
[`requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/)
file in your repository. You may also see `requirements-dev.txt` for
dependencies only used for contributing to the project, such as linters or test
runners. You must manually identify your requirements and keep requirements
files up to date.

Tools such as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) manage dependencies for you
and keep track of everything you've installed. Installing a dependency through
Poetry will add it to a "lockfile", which stores the exact versions of each
package needed to replicate your environment. Without a lockfile, future users
may try to run your project with more recent versions of your dependencies,
with which it might not work correctly.

See [Poetry: Basic usage](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) to set
up your project with Poetry.

## Package your project

Consider [packaging your Python
project](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
to make it easy for others to install and use. You should also consider
uploading your package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) so it can be installed
through `pip`.

If your project is a transpiler plugin, see [Create a transpiler
plugin](/guides/create-transpiler-plugin) to integrate correctly with Qiskit's
transpiler. This makes it easy for users to incorporate your plugin into their
Qiskit code.

## Test your project

Tests are small functions you'll write to make sure your code is working
correctly. A good test suite makes working on your code easier; if the tests
pass, your code works. This means you can be confident you haven't broken
anything when refactoring or adding new features. Seeing tests in a project's
repository gives users more confidence in the stability of the project.

The two most popular testing frameworks in Python are:
* [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
* Python's built-in [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

You can also consider using [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/4.18.0/) to test your
project against different versions of Python. Tox [is compatible](https://python-poetry.org/docs/faq/#is-tox-supported) with Poetry.

## Code quality tools

A linter is a tool that detects (and sometimes corrects) common problems in
your code. Formatters will auto-format your code to use a consistent style.

A popular linter for Python is
[`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), which also
includes a formatter (based on the popular tool [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).
Other popular tools include
[`mypy`](https://www.mypy-lang.org/) for type-checking, and
[`bandit`](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for security scanning.

Once you've set up your tools, you can use a [GitHub action](#github) to make
sure all code pushed to your repository has been linted.

Document how to run the linters and formatters in your README.md or CONTRIBUTOR.md.
