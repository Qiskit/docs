# Introduction

IBM Quantum&trade; maintains the worldâ€™s most advanced fleet of quantum systems, with seven [utility-scale](https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/new-ibm-quantum-systems-on-the-ibm-cloud/) quantum systems, and more on the way. These systems demonstrate unparalleled reliability, with >95% uptime across the fleet of quantum systems - and unmatched stability, with two-qubit gate error fluctuations no larger than 0.001 over timescales measured in months[^1].

## Run on hardware

Step 3 in Qiskit Patterns, "Run on hardware," centers around the [Qiskit Runtime primitives](/run/primitives) as the interface with IBM Quantum&trade; hardware, abstracting away error suppression and mitigation techniques so that you can focus more on the outcomes of your quantum computation.

In addition to detailed information on primitives, you can read about the available execution modes in this section. While you can always submit a single job at a time, you can also use Runtime Primitives to run jobs in a [session](/run/sessions) or in [batch mode](/run/run-jobs-batch). These execution modes assist your utility-scale jobs to run efficiently. 

This section also includes a page about our [processor types](/run/processor-types), how to [monitor jobs](/run/monitor-job) and [get information about our systems with the Qiskit SDK](/run/get-backend-information), details about [Quantum Serverless](/run/quantum-serverless), and more.
