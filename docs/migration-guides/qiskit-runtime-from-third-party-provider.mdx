# Migrate from a third-party provider

This topic shows how to migrate code from a third-party provider that implemented `IBMBackend.run()` to use `qiskit_ibm_runtime`.

The Qiskit SDK offers wrappers for `backend.run` that can be easily adapted to a custom primitives workflow
through subclassing; these are the [`BackendEstimatorV2`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendEstimatorV2) and [`BackendSamplerV2`.](/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2) The inputs
to the primitives should follow the Primitive Unified Bloc (PUB) syntax specified in the V2 primitives interface. See the [Overview of PUBs section](/guides/primitive-input-output#pubs) in the Primitive inputs and outputs guide for details.

An advantage of this strategy is that the wrapper can handle the input and output manipulation, so knowledge of the PUB data
model is not required. However, this might result in a suboptimal runtime, which could be refined through a fully
custom primitives implementation.

The following snippets show how to create a custom Estimator instance following the strategy described above.
The process is analogous for a custom Sampler, modifying the base class to `BackendSamplerV2`.

``` python
from qiskit.primitives import BackendEstimatorV2

class CustomEstimator(BackendEstimatorV2):
    """Estimator primitive for custom provider."""

    # This line is for type checking purposes.
    # We are changing the type of self._backend from qiskit's
    # BackendV1/BackendV2 classes to our custom provider resource.
    _backend: CustomProviderResource

    def __init__(
        self,
        backend: CustomProviderResource,
        options: dict | None = None,
        extra_flag_used_in_estimation: bool = True,
        another_extra_flag: bool = False,
    ) -> None:
        """
        Args:
            backend: custom provider resource to evaluate circuits on.
            options: options passed to through to the underlying BackendEstimatorV2.
            extra_flag_used_in_estimation:  if `False`, do this.
            another_extra_flag: if `True`, do that,
        """

        # preprocess arguments if necessary according to custom flags
        processed_backend = ...
        processed_options = ...

        super().__init__(
            processed_backend,
            options=processed_options,
        )

    @property
    def backend(self) -> CustomProviderResource:
        """Computing resource used for circuit evaluation."""
        return self._backend
```
