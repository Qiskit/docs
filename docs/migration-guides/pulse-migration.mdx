# Pulse migration guide

With the introduction of [fractional gates](../guides/fractional-gates), pulse-level control on all IBM Quantum processors has been deprecated and will be removed in early 2025. Additionally, the `qiskit.pulse` module has been deprecated as of the Qiskit SDK v1.3.0 and will be removed in Qiskit SDK v2.0.0. This change was motivated by our ongoing efforts aimed at utility-scale experiments and encouraging users to explore applications which may lead to quantum advantage.

## Execute single and two-qubit rotations directly with fractional gates

The most common use-case of pulse-level control was to build custom pulse schedules to modify the `ECR` or `RX` pulses to directly execute single and two-qubit rotations. Typically this was done through the `RXCalibrationBuilder` and `RZXCalibrationBuilder` (or `RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`) wherein you would add either a `RXGate` or `RZXGate` instruction to an IBM Quantum backend's `target` and build a transpilation pipeline which contain the calibration builder passes to calibrate the single and two-qubit rotations for a specified angle. Under the hood this created a map between a `ScheduleBlock` and a gate in a `QuantumCircuit` referred to as a *calibration*.

This can now be accomplished on Heron processors using the new `use_fractional_gates` flag. As specified in the [guides page](../guides/fractional-gates) on fractional gates, both $R_X(\theta)$ and $R_ZZ(\theta)$ must be loaded using this flag which returns a backend whose `Target` attribute contains information about these gates.

```python
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend('ibm_torino', use_fractional_gates=True)
```


## Use Qiskit dynamics

The `qiskit.pulse` module contained much more functionality than just executing single and two-qubit rotations more efficiently. Much of the control over device physics can be modeled using the [Qiskit Dynamics](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-dynamics/) package found in the Qiskit Ecosystem. The documentation of this package contains a few tutorials which may be helpful:
