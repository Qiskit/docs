    "# Introduction to the Transpiler\n",
    "\n",
    "A central component of Qiskit Terra is the transpiler, which is designed for modularity and extensibility. The goal is to be able to easily write new circuit transformations (known as transpiler **passes**), and combine them with other existing passes.  Which passes are chained together and in which order has a major effect on the final outcome. This pipeline is determined by a **pass manager**, which schedules the passes and also allows passes to communicate with each other by providing a shared space. In this way, the transpiler opens up the door for research into aggressive optimization of quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we look at the built-in passes, how to use the pass manager, and develop a simple custom transpiler pass. In order to do the latter, we first need to introduce the internal representation of quantum circuits in Qiskit, in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph, or **DAG**. Then, we illustrate a simple swap mapper pass, which transforms an input circuit to be compatible with a limited-connectivity quantum device.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Before you start***: You may need to install the `pydot` library and the `graphviz` library for the DAG plotting routines. If you are using Anaconda Python, you can install both with the `conda` command. If you use your system's native Python interpreter, install `pydot` using the `pip` command, and install `graphviz` using your system's native package manager (e.g. `yum`, `apt`, `dnf`, `brew`, etc.)."
