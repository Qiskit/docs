# AI transpiler passes
â€‹
The AI-powered transpiler passes are experimental passes that work as a drop-in replacement of "traditional" qiskit passes for some selected transpiling tasks. They often produce better results than existing heuristic algorithms (such as lower depth and CNOT count), but are also much faster than optimization algorithms such as Boolean satisfiability solvers. The AI transpiler passes run on the cloud and are available to IBM Quantum Premium Plan users.

The following passes are currently available:

**Routing passes**
 - `AIRouting`: Layout selection and circuit routing

The following passes will be available in Q1 2024.

**Circuit synthesis passes**
 - `AICliffordSynthesis`: Clifford circuit synthesis
 - `AILinearFunctionSynthesis`: Linear function circuit synthesis
 - `AIPermutationSynthesis`: Permutation circuit synthesis

To use the AI transpiler passes, make sure the package `qiskit-transpiler-service` is installed, check out the [Qiskit transpiler service](docs/transpile/qiskit-transpiler-service.mdx) docs for details.

## AI routing pass

The `AIRouting` pass acts both as a layout stage and a routing stage. It can be used within a `PassManager` in the following way:

```python
from qiskit.transpiler import PassManager
from qiskit_transpiler_service.ai.routing import AIRouting
from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2

ai_passmanager = PassManager([
  AIRouting(target="ibm_sherbrooke", optimization_level=2, layout_mode="optimize")
])

circuit = EfficientSU2(120, entanglement="circular", reps=1).decompose()

transpiled_circuit = ai_passmanager.run(circuit)
```

Here, the `target` determines which backend to route for, the `optimization_level` (1, 2, or 3) determines the computational effort to spend in the process (higher usually gives better results but takes longer), and the `layout_mode` specifies how to handle the layout selection.
The `layout_mode` includes the following options:
- `keep`: This respects the layout set by the previous transpiler passes (or uses the trivial layout if not set). This is typically only used when it is required to run the circuit on specific qubits of the device. It often produces worse results since it has less room for optimization.
- `improve`: This uses the layout set by the previous transpiler passes as a starting point and improves the existing layout from there. It is useful when you have a good initial guess for the layout; for example,for circuits that are built in a way that approximately follows the device's coupling map. It is also useful if you want to try other specific layout passes combined with the `AIRouting` pass.
- `optimize`: This is the default mode, and it works best for general circuits where you may not have good layout guesses. This mode ignores previous layout selections and finds a layout on its own.
