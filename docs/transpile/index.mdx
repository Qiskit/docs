# Introduction to the Transpiler

A central component of Qiskit Terra is the transpiler, which is designed for modularity and extensibility. The goal is to be able to easily write new circuit transformations (known as transpiler **passes**), and combine them with other existing passes.  Which passes are chained together and in which order has a major effect on the final outcome. This pipeline is determined by a **pass manager**, which schedules the passes and also allows passes to communicate with each other by providing a shared space. In this way, the transpiler opens up the door for research into aggressive optimization of quantum circuits.

In this notebook, we look at the built-in passes, how to use the pass manager, and develop a simple custom transpiler pass. In order to do the latter, we first need to introduce the internal representation of quantum circuits in Qiskit, in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph, or **DAG**. Then, we illustrate a simple swap mapper pass, which transforms an input circuit to be compatible with a limited-connectivity quantum device.

***Before you start***: You may need to install the `pydot` library and the `graphviz` library for the DAG plotting routines. If you are using Anaconda Python, you can install both with the `conda` command. If you use your system's native Python interpreter, install `pydot` using the `pip` command, and install `graphviz` using your system's native package manager (e.g. `yum`, `apt`, `dnf`, `brew`, etc.).
