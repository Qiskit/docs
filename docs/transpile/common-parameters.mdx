# Commonly used parameters

Following are some of the more commonly used transpilation parameters.

<span id="approx-degree"></span>
## Approximation degree

You can use the approximation degree to specify how closely you want the resultant circuit to match the desired (input) circuit.  This is a float in the range (0.0 - 1.0), where 0.0 is maximum approximation and 1.0 (default) is no approximation. Smaller values trade output accuracy for ease of execution (that is, fewer gates).  The default value is 1.0.

In two-qubit unitary synthesis (used with optimization level 3), this value specifies the target fidelity of the output decomposition. That is, how much error is introduced when a matrix representation of a circuit is converted to discrete gates. If the approximation degree is a lower value (more approximation), the output circuit from synthesis will differ more from the input matrix, but will also likely have fewer gates (because any arbitrary two-qubit operation can be decomposed perfectly with at most three CX gates) and is easier to run. 

When the approximation degree is less than 1.0, circuits with one or two CX gates might be synthesized, leading to less error from the hardware, but more from the approximation. Since CX is the most expensive gate in terms of error, it might be beneficial to decrease the number of them at the cost of fidelity in synthesis (this technique was used to increase quantum volume on IBM devices: [Validating quantum computers using randomized model circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12926)). 

## Seed transpiler

Sets the random seed for the stochastic parts of the transpiler, used for reproducibility. 

Example:

```python
    optimized_1 = transpile(qc, backend=backend, seed_transpiler=11, optimization_level=1)
```

<span id="init-layout"></span>
## Initial layout

Specifies the initial position of virtual qubits on physical qubits. If this layout makes the circuit compatible with the `coupling_map` constraints, it will be used. The final layout is not guaranteed to be the same, as the transpiler might permute qubits through swaps or other means. Multiple formats are supported. Multiple formats are supported:

    * Layout instance
    * Dict 
      - virtual to physical:
        ```python
        {qr[0]: 0,
        qr[1]: 3,
        qr[2]: 5}
        ```
      - physical to virtual:
        ```python
        {0: qr[0],
        3: qr[1],
         5: qr[2]}
        ```

    * List
      - virtual to physical:
        ```python
        [0, 3, 5]  # virtual qubits are ordered (in addition to named)
        ```
      -  physical to virtual:
        ```python
        [qr[0], None, None, qr[1], None, qr[2]]
        ```

## *_method 

These options influence how the transpiler works and are used to try and get better, different, or specific output from the transpiler.
 
* `init_method` (str) - The plugin to use for the initialization stage. To see a list of installed plugins, run [list_stage_plugins(init).](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_plugins#plugin-api)

* `layout_method` (str) - The layout selection pass (`trivial`, `dense`, `noise_adaptive`, `sabre`). This can also be the external plugin name to use for the layout stage. To see a list of installed plugins, run [list_stage_plugins(layout).](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_plugins#plugin-api)

* `optimization_method` (str) - The plugin to use for the optimization stage. To see a list of installed plugins, run [list_stage_plugins(optimization).](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_plugins#plugin-api)

* `routing_method` (str) - Name of routing pass (`basic`, `lookahead`, `stochastic`, `sabre`, `none`). This can also be the external plugin name to use for the routing stage. To see a list of installed plugins, run [list_stage_plugins(routing).](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_plugins#plugin-api)

* `scheduling_method` (str) - Name of scheduling pass. This can also be the external plugin name to use for the scheduling stage. To see a list of installed plugins, run [list_stage_plugins(scheduling).](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_plugins#plugin-api)
  * `as_soon_as_possible`: Schedule instructions greedily: as early as possible on a qubit resource (alias: `asap`).
  * `as_late_as_possible`: Schedule instructions late.  That is, keep qubits in the ground state when possible (alias: `alap`).

* `translation_method` (str) - Name of translation pass (`unroller`, `translator`, `synthesis`). This can also be the external plugin name to use for the translation stage. To see a list of installed plugins, run [list_stage_plugins(translation).](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit/transpiler_plugins#plugin-api)

* `unitary_synthesis_method` (str) - The name of the unitary synthesis method to use. By default `default` is used. To see a list of installed plugins, run [unitary_synthesis_plugin_names().](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.synthesis.plugin.unitary_synthesis_plugin_names#qiskittranspilerpassessynthesispluginunitary_synthesis_plugin_names)
