    "# Commonly used parameters for transpilation\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some of the more commonly used parameters for local transpilation using the `transpile()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"approx-degree\"></span>\n",
    "## Approximation degree\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the approximation degree to specify how closely you want the resultant circuit to match the desired (input) circuit.  This is a float in the range (0.0 - 1.0), where 0.0 is maximum approximation and 1.0 (default) is no approximation. Smaller values trade output accuracy for ease of execution (that is, fewer gates).  The default value is 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In two-qubit unitary synthesis (used in initial stages of all levels and for optimization stage with optimization level 3), this value specifies the target fidelity of the output decomposition. That is, how much error is introduced when a matrix representation of a circuit is converted to discrete gates. If the approximation degree is a lower value (more approximation), the output circuit from synthesis will differ more from the input matrix, but will also likely have fewer gates (because any arbitrary two-qubit operation can be decomposed perfectly with at most three CX gates) and is easier to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the approximation degree is less than 1.0, circuits with one or two CX gates might be synthesized, leading to less error from the hardware, but more from the approximation. Since CX is the most expensive gate in terms of error, it might be beneficial to decrease the number of them at the cost of fidelity in synthesis (this technique was used to increase quantum volume on IBM&reg; devices: [Validating quantum computers using randomized model circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12926)).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we generate a random two-qubit `UnitaryGate` which will be synthesized in the initial stage. Setting the `approximation_degree` less than 1.0 might generate an approximate circuit. We must also specify the `basis_gates` to let the synthesis method know which gates it can use for the approximate synthesis."

Due to the stochastic nature of the transpiler if you run `transpile()` multiple times with the same configuration you are not guaranteed to get the same output each time. So if you are experimenting with transpilation and require the same transpiled output every time you can do so by setting the `seed_transpiler` argument.\n",
