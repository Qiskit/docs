# Transpilation default settings and configuration options

Abstract circuits need to be transpiled because backends have a limited set of basis gates and cannot execute arbitrary operations. The transpiler's function is to change arbitrary circuits so that they can run on specified backend.  This is done by translating the circuits to the supported basis gates, and by introducing SWAP gates as needed, so that the circuit's connectivity matches that of the backend.
