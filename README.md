# How tos

## Pre-requisites to run tools locally

These tools will also run in CI. But, it can be convenient when iterating to run the tools locally.

First, install the below:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). If you expect to use JavaScript in other projects, consider using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Otherwise, consider using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node) or installing [Node.js directly](https://nodejs.org/en).

Then, install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Check file metadata

Every file needs to have a `title` and `description`. The `lint` job in CI will fail with instructions for any bad file.

You can also check for valid metadata locally:

```bash
# Only check file metadata
npm run check:metadata

# Or, run all the checks
npm run check
```

## Spellcheck

We use [cSpell](https://cspell.org) to check for spelling. The `lint` job in CI will fail if there are spelling issues.

There are two ways to check spelling locally, rather than needing CI.

1. 

```bash
# Only check spelling
npm run check:spelling

# Or, run all the checks
npm run check
```

2. Use the VSCode extension [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).

### Fixing false positives

There are two ways to deal with cSpell incorrectly complaining about a word, such as abbreviations.

1. Ignore the word in the local markdown file by adding a comment to the file, like below. The word is not case-sensitive, and the comment can be placed anywhere.

```
{/* cspell:ignore hellllooooo, ayyyyy */}

# Hellllooooo!

Ayyyyy, this is a fake description.
```

2. Add the word to the file `cSpell.json` in the `words` section. The word is not case-sensitive.

If the word appears in multiple files, prefer the second approach to add it to `cSpell.json`.
